Recently, I finished reading [_The Defining Decade_](https://bookshop.org/books/the-defining-decade-why-your-twenties-matter-and-how-to-make-the-most-of-them-now/9780446561754) by [Meg Jay](https://megjay.com). I didn't think this book was going to be as groundbreaking for me as it was. Not only did I find it educational and insightful, but I also found it tremendously inspiring and uplifting. I only wish I had held out for the newly revised and updated version coming out in March of 2021.

So, I thought I'd take the chance to process some of my initial thoughts in blog posts. So, this collection will consist of three posts, one for each of the three main sections of the book: Work, Love, and The Brain and the Body. Each post should serve as a summary of that section of the book, with quotes, paraphrases, and personal attestations.

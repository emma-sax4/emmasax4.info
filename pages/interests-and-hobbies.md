## Traveling

I know I already claimed to love traveling, but since I try to go to a new country every year, here's a cool list of all of the foreign countries (or non-continental U.S. states/territories) I've been to:

<ol start="0">
  <li>China 🇨🇳</li>
  <li>Iceland 🇮🇸  — it was only a layover and I never left the Reykjavík airport, but I like to count it anyways</li>
  <li>France 🇫🇷</li>
  <li>Spain 🇪🇸</li>
  <li>Puerto Rico 🇵🇷</li>
  <li>Alaska 🇺🇸</li>
  <li>Netherlands 🇳🇱  — also a layover, and I also never left the Amsterdam airport</li>
  <li>Czech Republic 🇨🇿</li>
  <li>Austria 🇦🇹</li>
  <li>Germany 🇩🇪</li>
  <li>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿</li>
  <li>Montréal 🇨🇦 — technically Canada, but saying <i>Montréal</i> is cooler than saying <i>Canada</i></li>
  <li>Kenya 🇰🇪</li>
</ol>

## [LEGO Sets and MOCs](/interests-and-hobbies/lego/)

In April 2020, I started to get involved more with LEGO. I think a huge part of this is because we're all stuck inside from the COVID-19 pandemic. But, I discovered a tool called [BrickLink Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page), and you can use it to build your own LEGO sets. This tool looks like it's from BrickLink, but it's fully supported by LEGO as well... in fact, LEGO's own employees use Studio to build the official sets! So, I thought I'd share some of the LEGO sets I've built and designed (also called MOCs—or My Own Creations), as well as some LEGO sets I've purchased and played around with. See my [dedicated LEGO page](/interests-and-hobbies/lego/) for more!

## [Theatre](/interests-and-hobbies/theatre/)

When I was in middle school and high school, my family and I spent countless hours driving to and from rehearsals from shows. Every show I was a part of was enjoyable, and I loved learning from all of the cast and crew members I worked with. For a list of the shows I worked with and the training I participated in, see my [dedicated Theatre page](/interests-and-hobbies/theatre/). Huge shoutout and thank you to my family for always being supportive of my theatre pasttime and for always being willing to help me out.

      <h2>Who am I? What do I like?</h2>

      <p>Hi! My name is Emma Sax. I am currently a Platform Operations Engineer at <a href="https://www.sportsengine.com/solutions/" target="_blank">SportsEngine</a>. Before I started there full-time in 2017, I graduated from the University of Minnesota Morris (UMM) with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. Before college, I was highly involved in theatre, dance, and music around the Twin Cities, where I grew up, and still live today. My background in the arts has allowed me to have a unique perspective on programming, software development, and DevOps. Going forward, I hope to continue to grow as a person, artist, and engineer.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I like to go on walks and hikes, swim (as much swimming as possible), hang out with friends and family, and binge watch TV shows (my favorite one is <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Bones</a></i>). My favorite author is <a href="https://www.jodipicoult.com/" target="_blank">Jodi Picoult</a>; I love how her novels (which are often about controversial topics) make her readers rethink how they view the topic, society, and allow us to see that even the people that disagree with us have their reasons, and are right in their own way. These are lessons that sometimes I think Americans in the 21st Century forget.</p>

      <p>Funny fact, if you catch me on a good day, you can probably catch me lip syncing along with some of my favorite Broadway musicals' songs. I'm particularly a fan of musicals like <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Girls_(musical)" target="_blank">Mean Girls</a></i>, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_(musical)" target="_blank">Anastasia</a></i>, and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legally_Blonde_(musical)" target="_blank">Legally Blonde</a></i> because they're upbeat, fun, and have great music and fun dance numbers. A five, six, seven, eight!</p>

      <p>I love to travel, expecially to international places. Even though it can be expensive to travel, I try to go to a new country every year. Here's a list of some of the foreign countries I've been to:
        <ol start="0">
          <li>China</li>
          <li>France</li>
          <li>Spain</li>
          <li>Czech Republic</li>
          <li>Austria</li>
          <li>Germany</li>
          <li>England</li>
          <li>Montréal — technically Canada, but saying <i>Montréal</i> is way cooler than saying <i>Canada</i></li>
          <li>Kenya</li>
        </ol>
        I do try to collect a tourist-y magnet of each city (or landmark) I visit within each country. If you want to see a picture of them, feel free to just let me know!
      </p>

      <p>** I started the bullet list with 0 for two reasons: (1) I was born in China, so I never had to "travel" there, and (2) I'm in engineering.</p>

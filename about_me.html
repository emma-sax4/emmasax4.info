      <h2>Who am I? What do I like?</h2>

      <p>My name is Emma Sax. I am currently a Platform Operations Engineer at <a href="https://www.sportsengine.com/solutions/" target="_blank">SportsEngine</a>.</p>

      <p>I graduated from the University of Minnesota Morris (UMM) with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science.</p>

      <p>Before college, I was involved in theatre, dance, and music around the Twin Cities. This experience has allowed me to have a unique perspective on programming, software development, and DevOps.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I like to go on walks and hikes, swim (as much swimming as possible), and hang out with friends and family.</p>

      <p>I also love to travel, expecially to international places. I try to go to a new country every year. Here's a list of some of the foreign countries I've been to:
        <ol start="0">
          <li>China</li>
          <li>France</li>
          <li>Spain</li>
          <li>Czech Republic</li>
          <li>Austria</li>
          <li>Germany</li>
          <li>England</li>
          <li>Montréal — technically Canada, but saying <i>Montréal</i> is way cooler than saying <i>Canada</i></li>
          <li>Kenya</li>
        </ol>
        I try to collect a "tourist's" magnet of each city (or landmark) I visit within each country. If you want to see a picture of them, let me know!
      </p>

      <p>** I started the bullet list with 0 for two reasons: (1) I was born in China, so I never had to "travel" there, and (2) I'm in engineering.</p>

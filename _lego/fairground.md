I originally got this set because it had a lot of minifigures. As any of my readers of my LEGO creations can tell, I love my minifigures.

But as I was putting together this set, I realized that it came with a lot of intricate parts. All of the fairground games are actually usable (granted on a really small scale). The game where you hit the platform with a mallot to raise the ball to the bell at the top really works if you bop it with a little oomf. The event where you shoot down the targets works with the little toy shooter. And the duck-ring toss really spins! I'm very impressed, not just with the minifigures, but with the details in the set design as well.

The only thing I can't figure out is what the blue paddle is supposed to be...

In my pictures, I added a green floor to keep all of the pieces together and standing—that base plate does _not_ come with the set.

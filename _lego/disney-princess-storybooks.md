At first glance, I wasn't interested in these LEGO sets because the minifigures are a different design. But after I realized they had a _Mulan_ set (she's my favorite because she's Chinese), I realized that I should give it a chance.

So I started with just that one box. I actually really liked it. I liked how the entire set collapses into this latching book for easy moving around. I think the minifigures are actually really cute, and as much as I hate putting stickers on, I like how customizable the stickers make the set.

So I started moving onto other boxes... first _Little Mermaid_, then _Frozen_, and lastly, _Beauty and the Beast_. After I had them all, they make quite a picture perfect little collection all lined up together.

Out of all of them, I'd actually say my favorite is either _Frozen_ or _Mulan_, just because I think they're so adorable. But as a set of four, they're just about perfect all on a shelf together.

Based on both of the previous dorm room types, this one is for a student who wishes to live alone. They have a little couch and coffee table, along with a full bathroom, and washer/dryer. They also have a full bedroom as well, but it's all within the same main room, so it's basically a little studio apartment without a kitchen. It's vents are realistic, and contains two doors. However, there are no windows, which isn't particularly realistic.

In terms of the LEGO aspect, the room's walls are made of about 135 pieces. Viewers need to use their imagination for the armoire; I didn't create it with doors, but the idea is that there's a rod, and minifigures can hang up their clothes. There's two chests, one that doesn't have a lid that students could put blankets or games in.

If this were a LEGO designed set, it would include more accessories like notebooks, pens, and wall decorations, but I wanted to keep it relatively inexpensive to get all of the pieces.

Including all of the minifigures, the entire set has about 405 LEGO pieces.

Here's a link to the instructions and piece list of the dorm room: <a href="/assets/resources/LEGO-singles-dorm-room-bathroom.pdf" target="_blank">LEGO-singles-dorm-room-bathroom.pdf</a>

NOTE: the piece list numbers can sometimes be out of sync with what's in the LEGO Bricks and Pieces database. Sometimes I need to do a more thorough Google search in order to find the correct piece number.

In normal circumstances, I wouldn't purchase any LEGO sets from _Monkie Kid_. I'm not even entirely sure what it is... maybe a TV show or movie brand or something? We received the set as a LEGO freebie when making another LEGO purchase. However, I found it was actually pretty enjoyable to put together.

Putting together the little motorcycle was fun, and the minifigure's facial expressions are definitely worth it. All-in-all, it was a fun little 10 minutes to spend doing LEGO. I wouldn't spend any actual money on this set though.

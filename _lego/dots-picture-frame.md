At first, I was a bit skeptical about these DOTS sets. How am I supposed to make sure that my design looks good? So I started off by copying one of the example pictures, but soon realized that with DOTS, everything you'd make looks just fine! There's no way to go wrong with DOTS; they provide space for creativity and flexibility, giving plenty of ways to let out our inner kid!

Here's a link to the set: [DOTS Picture Frame (41914)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/creative-picture-frames-41914)

Also featured in the last photograph is my personal minifigure that my coworker made at the LEGO store for me. Holding a wand, because I'm a _Harry Potter_ lover, and on a platform decorated with leftover DOTS pieces.

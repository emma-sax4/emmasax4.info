I got this Charles Dickens Tribute set as a free extra set from spending a certain amount of money at the LEGO store. I'm not normally a Charles Dickens or a _Christmas Carol_ fan, so normally, I wouldn't spend any money on this type of set. But putting it together was actually an absolute joy!

It was fun watching the book go from a wobbly frame to something sturdy, and the little room had lots of details with stickers and everything. I love how each of the minifigures have at least one stud to stand on, and the inside of the room is completely lined with tiles, meaning the floor is completely flat. As a bonus, the entire finished set still fits inside the original box, making it a perfect little gift for the holidays!

I think perhaps the greatest part of this set, though, is the fact that it has a built-in little drawer. Since I'm gifting it to somebody for the holiday, the drawer is perfect for putting all of the extra LEGO pieces in. they fit perfectly, and don't even wobble around too much.

Overall, the design of this little set was really great, and it was enjoyable to put together.

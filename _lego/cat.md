I was so excited when I saw that one of the freebies at the LEGO store was a little cat! It was also a 3-in-1, so it also came with an ostrich option and a cute little crab option. I put all three designs together to see which ones I liked the most.

The crab was by far the cutest. Its claws were a stretch, but I do have to give the designer credit for being able to come up with so many designs with so few pieces. The ostrich was impressive, essentially considering _how_ it used all of the LEGO pieces. The cat.... well, I think it may be the ugliest LEGO cat I've ever seen. It was very disappointing. The way my partner described it was that this set was designed by somebody who _hates_ cats and was just forced to make one.

However, putting all three mini-sets together made for a fun little afternoon of LEGO. But if you're deciding to purchase this set (if it's even available for purchase), don't spend money hoping for an adorable little kitty, because what you'll actually get is the cat of your nightmares.

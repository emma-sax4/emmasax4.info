Over two months ago I wrote my second installment of the [Welcome to Kenya](/set/welcome-to-kenya) blog set. In it, I told the summarized story of the northern white rhinos. Please read about it [here](/posts/welcome-to-kenya/2019-09-16-the-game-drives).

In light of the recent events, I decided to write a special blog post beyond the original five I intended to write. It is official: the <a href="https://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/" target="_blank">Ol Pejeta Conservancy</a> and <a href="https://safaripark.cz/" target="_blank">Dv√ºr Kr√°lov√© Zoo</a> have created the first ever Northern White Rhino in-vitro embryos!

> _For decades the story of the northern white rhinoceros has been a tale of decline. The number of individuals shrank down to only two in 2018, rendering complete extinction as only a matter of time. An international consortium of scientists and conservationists has now achieved a milestone in assisted reproduction that may be a pivotal turning point in the fate of these magnificent animals. Using eggs collected from the two remaining females and frozen sperm from deceased males, they successfully created two northern white rhino embryos. The embryos are now stored in liquid nitrogen to be transferred into a surrogate mother in the near future._

This groundbreaking news provides the opportunity to save the northern white rhinos, one animal at a time. Now, I don't want to make things seem happier than they are. This is a huge breakthrough, but there's still a lot at risk. Having four northern white rhinos doesn't mean the species will definitely come back. There are still risks (as with any birth), and the potential to be able to make more rhino babies after these ones is still limited. It will take decades of research, work, and failed attempts at fertilization in order to bring back a small northern white population. All we can hope is that the world sees these beautiful creatures and understands that losing them would be a devastating event for all of us. We hope that Kenya can work to protect these unborn baby rhinos, and we applaud Ol Pejeta and Dv√ºr Kr√°lov√© on their tireless efforts to save the northern white rhinos.

I'd like to extend a huge thank you to both the Ol Pejeta Conservancy and Dv√ºr Kr√°lov√© Zoo, and I'll be checking up periodically to read your newsletters about our new baby white rhinos ü¶è.

## Side Note

There are still poachers out there that want to kill our beautiful African animals. The most recent one to surface on social media is Jimmy John Liautaud, the founder and owner of <a href="https://www.jimmyjohns.com/" target="_blank">Jimmy Johns</a>. Now, I'm as much a fan of Jimmy Johns' sandwiches as the next person. But the thought of poaching these beautiful creatures disgusts me. In fact, there's an actual picture of Liautaud killing the **_last female northern white rhino_** in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangetti_National_Park" target="_blank">Mangetti Nation Park</a> in Namibia.

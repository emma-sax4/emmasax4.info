When I dug out the original post [Skimp and Splurge: The Art of Saving Money](posts/2019-10-19-skimp-and-splurge) from my Google Drive, I was immediately humored by my original intent to create a blog. As you can probably tell, that never actually came to fruition... Until I decided to adventure with GitHub Pages. Although, most of that is another story.

What actually inspired me to publish that original "post" from 2016 was that a lot of the opinions I had on it have changed. When I wrote that originally, I wasn't even graduated from college yet. I was still living in a dorm room (suite, technically), and I still had a small meal plan at my college's Dining Hall. I had a decent amount of money for a senior in college (since I worked part-time at SportsEngine during the last couple years of school), but that didn't necessarily prepare me for what living in the "real world" would be like.

What I learned quickly was that money doesn't grow on trees. What takes a person two weeks to earn goes pretty quickly when your rent is $1,300/month, your car payment is $400/month, and you still want to go out to eat at restaurants. And so, as I moved out of my parents home in the summer of 2017, my priorities began to shift away from what I thought they'd look like.

So, in honor of it being almost exactly three years after that original post, let's re-evaluate those 10 skimps and splurges.

### 1.

> **SKIMP: daily coffee**. In fact, I don’t drink any coffee at all. Call me lucky that I don’t need the pick-me-up of energy in the morning, but because of it, I can easily save $150 a month from frequent trips to Starbucks.

I still don't drink coffee. When I was in high school, everyone would tell me: "You may not need the caffeine yet, but just wait until college." When I got to college, everyone said: "You're a young freshman. Just wait until you're a senior." When I became a senior, people said: "It's amazing you don't need coffee right now, but just wait until after you graduate and start working full-time." And yet, here I am, 2.5 years after graduation, working full-time, and I _still_ don't drink coffee.

I believe I've had maybe three cups of coffee in my entire life, and each one of those had to be loaded up with sugars and creams to hide the bitter taste. In fact, one time my mom came over to my apartment and I offered her a cup of coffee. She said "that would be great", and then I offered to take my car to Starbucks—I don't own a coffee maker.

> **SPLURGE: apartment rent**. Even though apartments provide a low-contract living situation, I like knowing that the place I’m living in is decently nice, in a good neighborhood, and I would feel comfortable living there for years to come if I wanted to. And it’s not like I was super picky. In fact, my requirement for living there included 6 things:
* Central heat
* Air conditioning
* Dishwasher
* Underground parking available
* Free laundry (does not necessarily mean in-unit washer/dryer)
* Fitness room in building

Since I moved out of my parents home, I've lived in three apartments. And it's been only 2.5 years! There are some things in this category that haven't changed. I still like to live in a decently nice place. I will always try my darnedest not to live in a place where there's thefts, break-ins, and gunshots at night. But, it's okay if my apartment doesn't have a state-of-the-art gym facility.

So, here's my revised list of requirements:
* Central heat (we do live in Minnesota, so hopefully this is common)
* Air conditioning (less common than heat, but decently easy to find)
* Dishwasher (considering I use mine at least five times a week, I'd say this is a necessity for me)
* Underground parking available (I would also settle for an individual single-stall garage, because then I can use that for storage, but I do _not_ like brushing snow and ice off in the morning)
* Laundry (this doesn't need to be free, and it doesn't need to be in-unit, but I do think I'd put my foot down on the place if the machines used quarters)
* Fitness room in building (even though I don't go to the gym as often as I'd like to admit, it's still nice having this option in the building)
* Mail and package receiving (normal mail is common, package rooms are a newer amentity that I could see older complexes not having)
* Bonus: an indoor swimming pool and hot tub (I love to swim, in fact, it's probably my most preferred sport, so having these as bonus amentities make living anywhere way more enjoyable)
* No smoking in the building or on balconies (this is actually a huge one for me as a non-smoker.... I hate the smell of cigarettes)
* Comcast as an optional internet provider (since I work for NBCUniversal and Comcast, I get free internet and cable; there's no way I would willingly pay another internet provider when I could just get free internet through my work)

So... I guess my requirements list has gotten even longer. But one huge thing I have learned is that you may find an apartment that's great, and then learn that it's not as great as you thought. It's okay to move when your lease is over. In fact, financially that may be the best option, if your rent is increasing by a significant amount for the next year.

> **SKIMP: tons of new clothes**. Call it luck that at my job, jeans and t-shirts are totally appropriate, but I never am willing to spend more than about $30 on a shirt or a pair of pants if I don’t have to. Stay away from the designer stores and expensive retail stores. I only buy expensive clothes when I know I’ll be wearing them to a very important occasion.

### 4.

> **SPLURGE: eating at nice restaurants**. I don’t mean super pricey restaurants, just ones that aren’t fast-food chains. I would never skip on going out to eat with an old friend at a decently nice restaurant. Worst case scenario, I’m fed with good-tasting food, my wallet is $45 lighter, and I’ve gotten some socializing done with friend(s). Could be worse. And I’ll probably get leftovers out of it, too.

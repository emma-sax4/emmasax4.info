In Kenya, we stayed at several resorts at different locations around the Equator and in southern Kenya. Let's walk through each one, highlight the benefits of each of them, show some pictures, and talk about the buffet meals! Yum! 🍝🥩🥙🍇🥖🍷🥮

## Nairobi ☞ [Tamarind Tree Hotel](http://www.tamarindtree-hotels.com/)
Tamarind Tree Hotel was by far the nicest place we stayed at in Nairobi. It was colorful 🌈, clean 🧼, the food was delicious, and the staff was pleasant. The entire hotel felt very safe, as there were security measures everywhere.

When we arrived, there was a gate at the entrance with guards. After letting our trucks in, we were surprised to find there was a metal detector at the main entrance, which everybody had to go through before entering the actual hotel. Even all of our bags had to be scanned by an x-ray machine (like TSA at the airport).

To take an elevator to any floor (besides the ground floor), you needed to have a keycard for that specific floor. I appreciated the extra feeling of security, even if it was somewhat irritating when you wanted to visit another room on a different floor.

The shower was interesting—it was just a glass door (which you could see the person's head through), and the tile floor was the same as the tiles in the rest of the bathroom. By the way, the bathroom didn't even have a door! So it felt very exposed. It was fine when I was sharing a room with somebody I knew well, but it would've been more awkward if I was rooming with someone I had just met.

The beds were small (twin sized), but comfortable, especially since we had just come off of a long flight 🛩.

The food was delicious. However, the buffet meal (we were all on our own for dinner) cost around $30, or 3,000 KSH. Therefore, I ended up ordering some spaghetti and bruschetta (and my partner ordered some steak or something) from the normal menu. But, when I asked how the buffet was, everybody said it was delicious and worth the $30 to them. To each their own 🤷🏻‍♀️.

Unfortunately, my group didn't get any pictures of Tamarind Tree Hotel, but you can check out their website online (linked above).

## Aberdares County ☞ [The Ark](https://thearkkenya.com/)
The Ark was certainly the most unique place we stayed. The entire hotel/resort was designed to be like Noah's Ark, where the area is shaped like a boat. At the front (bow), there's four decks, and each one has an amazing view of a watering hole. A couple of the decks are actually outside, and this provides an amazing experience of the animals without glass—but be very quiet, or else the animals will get scared 🙀!

During the day, the watering hole and surrounding area has hyenas, buffalo, and warthogs. At night, the elephants come out, and stay for hours eating the nutrients (that are meticulously placed) in the dirt, and playing.

The rooms are small, but that's by design. They feel cozy and snug. The hallways are a maze, but you only need to know where to go a few places: your room, the entrance/exit, the decks, and the restaurant (but you can get to the food from the decks).

The air was a bit chilly at night (because of the higher altitude in the mountains), but the staff brought warm hot water packs to each bed at night, so our tootsies stayed nice and cozy.

Like Tamarind Tree Hotel, the food here was scrumptious. The breakfast had a made-to-order omelet bar, fresh juice, potatoes, eggs, fruit, rolls, and everything in between. Yum yum yum!

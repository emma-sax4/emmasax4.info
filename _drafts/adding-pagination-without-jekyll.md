As I stated in my original _[Switching to Jekyll](/thoughts/all/2019-09-09-switching-to-jekyll)_ post, one of the original reasons I wanted to move to a Jekyll-based site was so that I could implement pagination on my Thoughts page(s). Switching to Jekyll was definitely challenging, and it involved me learning a new framework, and essentially even a new language (liquid).

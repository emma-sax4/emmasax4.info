# Who am I? What do I like?

My name is Emma Sax. I am currently a Platform Operations Engineer at [SportsEngine](https://www.sportsengine.com/solutions/).

I graduated from the [University of Minnesota Morris (UMM)](https://www4.morris.umn.edu/) with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science in May of 2017.

Before college, I was involved in theatre, dance, and music around the Twin Cities. This experience has allowed me to have a unique perspective on programming, software development, and DevOps.

In my free time, I like to go on walks and hikes, swim (as much swimming as possible), and hang out with friends and family.

I also love to travel, expecially to international places. I try to go to a new country every year. Here's a list of some of the foreign countries I've been to:

<ol start="0">
  <li>China</li>
  <li>France</li>
  <li>Spain</li>
  <li>Czech Republic</li>
  <li>Austria</li>
  <li>Germany</li>
  <li>England</li>
  <li>Montréal — technically Canada, but saying <i>Montréal</i> is cooler than saying <i>Canada</i></li>
  <li>Kenya</li>
</ol>

I try to collect a "tourist's" magnet of each city (or landmark) I visit within each country. If you want to see a picture of them, let me know!

** I started the bullet list with 0 for two reasons: (1) I was born in China, so I never had to "travel" there, and (2) I'm in engineering.

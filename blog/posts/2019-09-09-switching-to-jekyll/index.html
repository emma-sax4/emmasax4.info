  <h1>Switching to Jekyll</h1>


    <div class="page-body">
      <p>A few days ago, I published another blog post (read it <a href="/posts/2019-09-06-my-first-blog-post">here</a>), in which I stated that although I wanted to originally try to use Jekyll more, I gave up, instead favoring raw HTML files, hard-coding the headers and links.</p>

<p>After reflecting on this decision (after publishing that post of course), I changed my mind. I don‚Äôt want to consider myself a giver-upper, and I certainly don‚Äôt want to shy away from learning new coding frameworks, all because I don‚Äôt want to spend a few more hours in front of the computer üíª. In fact, in the long run, utilizing Jekyll on this site will actually <em>save</em> me time (and code) as I continue to add more posts and content to the site. However, if I‚Äôm completely honest, the biggest thing that made me want to switch to Jekyll was the ugly pagination that would have to be hard-coded and change frequently as more posts were added to the site. By switching to be Jekyll-based, this could be avoided.</p>

<p>So, the first thing I did, after making this decision, was to find an example repository that used Jekyll, so I could copy off of it. I ended up selecting <a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci/senior-seminar" target="_blank">UMM-CSci‚Äôs <code class="highlighter-rouge">senior-seminar</code></a>, which I had made a few other pull requests for during and right after college. I choose this because I had seen the code before, even if I never took the time to look at it in detail, and I knew (or once knew) the main contributors to the repository. I also vaguely remember the switch from raw HTML and Markdown files to Jekyll-based, which took place in <a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci/senior-seminar/pull/9" target="_blank">this pull request</a>, even if I didn‚Äôt work on it myself. That pull request is hard to parse‚Ä¶ it has 355 changed files, no comments, and only vague descriptions. For my switch, I didn‚Äôt actually look at that PR, although I could‚Äôve if I had wanted to üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.</p>

<p>One of my flaws when I code is that I‚Äôm not always a big fan of thinking and reading‚Ä¶. I like to just jump in and start coding, especially if I‚Äôm working on my own project. So I skipped all of the official Jekyll documentation (I‚Äôve looked at it since when googling, but I didn‚Äôt start there), and I started copying files. I began with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes/</code> directory, AKA the first directory GitHub shows in the root directory. And I kept copying the basic files, making small changes to my copies, as necessary.</p>

<p>Before long, I had a working homepage, with a single item in the header ("Home"), and my pictures showed up. As I started adding more pages, I got more understanding of the purpose of each directory, and how the Markdown files and HTML files worked together. By the time I moved onto the most complicated page, the "Blog" page, I had a decent understanding of the basics of Jekyll.</p>

<p>But it wasn‚Äôt until I started working on the "Blog" page that I got to play around with collections, loops, <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code>s, etc. My first goal was to make the list of posts all show up as they were supposed to, with the proper title(s) and dates. It turns out Jekyll makes this pretty easy. This sweet line gathers all of the blog posts on the site:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Now, I know what you all may be thinking. "Of course Thanksgiving is about the food!" And I understand why you believe that. I get that many people feel this way. For many Americans, connecting with friends and family over food is totally normal and is a healthy way to bond with loved ones.

When you want to get together with old high school friends, you all go out for brunch. When you go on a first date, you go out to dinner. When you visit with your family, including your crazy Uncle Jim, you get together for dinner so you can get some ü•É inside him so his political jokes won't be as rude. When you go out for a business meeting, you go for lunch or for coffee. Americans, and possibly humans in general, love to bond over food.

So when it comes to Thanksgiving, it's all about the food. The turkey ü¶É, gravy, stuffing, etc. One household bites the bullet and decides to cook a lavish meal for their whole family. They stay up late on Wednesday cooking, and work tirelessly throughout Thursday morning and afternoon to prep even more food. And then, at the end of the meal, there's tons of leftovers. Leftovers for days! So many leftovers that you can hardly fit them all into the fridge. And inevitably, the house won't be able to finish all of the leftovers by the time they go bad.

I'm not saying that any of these habits are wrong. In fact, for many people and many households, it's a great tradition. But there are some people and some families that don't make Thanksgiving about the food. It's about spending time with family, catching up with one another, and being grateful for all of the things in their lives üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. They may eat a meal, but that's only because if you're together all afternoon, wouldn't you get hungry?

And the truth is, that for many people with eating disorders, or people that are on strict eating programs, Thanksgiving is not a friendly meal for them. Being part of a holiday that is so centered on eating tons of food isn't a healthy environment for some of these people to be in. Yes, everybody's experiences with it are going to be different. I can only speak to mine. Personally, I've been trying to eat healthier foods. And so, being around all of the pie ü•ß, rolls ü•ñ, and chocolates üç´ wasn't easy. This was exacerbated by the fact that my partner and I spent one Thanksgiving meal at my parents' house, and one at his mom's house. So we had _two_ dinners!

But my family was so understanding of the stress of this holiday. So my family did something new. We had an extremely healthy Thanksgiving! We're all vegetarian, so we skipped the turkey, gravy, and mashed potatoes. We had mashed cauliflower and sweet potatoes ü•î as a substitute. We didn't have any pie or ice cream, and instead had fresh fruit üçìüçá for dessert. Personally, I didn't eat any sugar at Thanksgiving, which is definitely a first for me.

What this whole post boils down to is that for many Americans, their favorite part of Thanksgiving is the feast. There's nothing wrong with that whatsoever. But for me, and for a solid chunk of Americans, it's good to remember that the food wasn't the original purpose of Thanksigiving (ignoring the whole colonization/Native American topic right now). The original purpose was to "give thanks for one's blessings, along with... [celebrating] ...a harvest."

So with that, have a happy holiday season, filled with love, joy, and gratefulness for one's family and friends ü•Ç.

Over two months ago I wrote my second installment of the [Welcome to Kenya](/set/welcome-to-kenya) blog set. In it, I told the shortened version of the story of the northern white rhinos. Please read about it [here](/posts/welcome-to-kenya/2019-09-16-the-game-drives) for context before continuing.

---

Recently, social media blew up over a posted picture of Jimmy John Liautaud, the founder and owner of &lt;a href="https://www.jimmyjohns.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jimmy Johns&lt;/a&gt;, posing in front of a dead African elephant, which he had killed as part of a hunting game drive. This upset me very much. Not only does this type of hunting make me cringe, but I'm also immediately concerned because I know that some species of African elephants are endangered. After doing more research, I found that Liautaud has also hunted giraffes, leopards, zebras, lions, and rhinoceroses. This last animal made me even more disgusted. There's an actual picture on Twitter of Liautaud killing the **_last female northern white rhino_** in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangetti_National_Park" target="_blank"&gt;Mangetti Nation Park&lt;/a&gt; in Namibia. Liautaud has literally contributed to the endangerment of northern white rhinos.

So, I decided to do two things. First, I decided to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23boycottjimmyjohns&amp;src=typeahead_click" target="_blank"&gt;#boycottjimmyjohns&lt;/a&gt;. I've never boycotted a restaurant before, but here goes nothing. I know that realistically, my boycott won't make much of a difference to a restaurant chain that just keeps growing in popularity, but intentionally not supporting and/or giving money to this man makes me feel a little bit better. Secondly, I decided to check back up on those rhino eggs that were fertilized in August of this past year.

And so, in light of all of these recent events, I decided to write a special blog post beyond the original five I intended to write. And the news is in: the &lt;a href="https://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Ol Pejeta Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://safaripark.cz/" target="_blank"&gt;Dv√ºr Kr√°lov√© Zoo&lt;/a&gt; have created the first ever Northern White Rhino in-vitro embryos!

&gt; _For decades the story of the northern white rhinoceros has been a tale of decline. The number of individuals shrank down to only two in 2018, rendering complete extinction as only a matter of time. An international consortium of scientists and conservationists has now achieved a milestone in assisted reproduction that may be a pivotal turning point in the fate of these magnificent animals. Using eggs collected from the two remaining females and frozen sperm from deceased males, they successfully created two northern white rhino embryos. The embryos are now stored in liquid nitrogen to be transferred into a surrogate mother in the near future._

This groundbreaking news provides the opportunity to save the northern white rhinos, one animal at a time. Now, I don't want to make things seem happier than they are. This is a huge breakthrough, but there's still a lot at risk. Having four northern white rhinos doesn't mean the species can grow in strength. There are still many risks (as with any birth), and the potential to be able to make more rhino babies after these ones is still limited. It will take decades of research, work, and failed attempts at fertilization in order to bring back a small northern white population.

All we can hope is that the world sees these beautiful creatures and understands that losing them would be a devastating loss for our ecosystem and our world. I hope Kenya can work to protect these rhinos from poachers like Jimmy John Liautaud.

When I dug out the original post [Skimp and Splurge: The Art of Saving Money](/posts/skimp-and-splurge/2019-10-19-the-art-of-saving-money) from my Google Drive, I was immediately humored by my original intent to create a blog. As you can probably tell, that never actually came to fruition... Until I decided to adventure with GitHub Pages. Although, most of that is another story.

What actually inspired me to publish that original "post" from 2016 was that a lot of the opinions I had on it have changed. When I wrote that originally, I wasn't even graduated from college yet. I was still living in a dorm room (suite, technically), and I still had a small meal plan at my college's Dining Hall. I had a decent amount of money for a senior in college (since I worked part-time at SportsEngine during the last couple years of school), but that didn't necessarily prepare me for what living in the "real world" would be like.

What I learned quickly was that money doesn't grow on trees. What takes a person two weeks to earn goes pretty quickly when your rent is $1,300/month, your car payment is $400/month, and you still want to go out to eat at restaurants. And so, as I moved out of my parents home in the summer of 2017, my priorities began to shift away from what I thought they'd look like.

So, in honor of it being almost exactly three years after that original post, let's re-evaluate those 10 skimps and splurges.

---

### 1.

&gt; **SKIMP: daily coffee**. In fact, I don‚Äôt drink any coffee at all. Call me lucky that I don‚Äôt need the pick-me-up of energy in the morning, but because of it, I can easily save $150 a month from frequent trips to Starbucks.

I still don't drink coffee. When I was in high school, everyone would tell me: "You may not need the caffeine yet, but just wait until college." When I got to college, everyone said: "You're a young freshman. Just wait until you're a senior." When I became a senior, people said: "It's amazing you don't need coffee right now, but just wait until after you graduate and start working full-time." And yet, here I am, 2.5 years after graduation, working full-time, and I _still_ don't drink coffee.

I believe I've had maybe three cups of coffee in my entire life, and each one of those had to be loaded up with sugars and creams to hide the bitter taste. In fact, one time my mom came over to my apartment and I offered her a cup of coffee. She said "that would be great", and then I offered to take my car to Starbucks‚ÄîI don't own a coffee maker.

### 2.

&gt; **SPLURGE: apartment rent**. Even though apartments provide a low-contract living situation, I like knowing that the place I‚Äôm living in is decently nice, in a good neighborhood, and I would feel comfortable living there for years to come if I wanted to. And it‚Äôs not like I was super picky. In fact, my requirement for living there included 6 things:
* Central heat
* Air conditioning
* Dishwasher
* Underground parking available
* Free laundry (does not necessarily mean in-unit washer/dryer)
* Fitness room in building

Since I moved out of my parents home, I've lived in three apartments. And it's been only 2.5 years! There are some things in this category that haven't changed. I still like to live in a decently nice place. I will always try my darnedest not to live in a place where there's thefts, break-ins, and gunshots at night. But, it's okay if my apartment doesn't have a state-of-the-art gym facility.

So, here's my revised list of requirements:
* Central heat (we do live in Minnesota, so hopefully this is common)
* Air conditioning (less common than heat, but decently easy to find)
* Dishwasher (considering I use mine at least five times a week, I'd say this is a necessity for me)
* Underground parking available (I would also settle for an individual single-stall garage, because then I can use that for storage, but I do _not_ like brushing snow and ice off in the morning)
* Laundry (this doesn't need to be free, and it doesn't need to be in-unit, but I do think I'd put my foot down on the place if the machines used quarters)
* Fitness room in building (even though I don't go to the gym as often as I'd like to admit, it's still nice having this option in the building)
* Mail and package receiving (normal mail is common, package rooms are a newer amentity that I could see older complexes not having)
* No smoking in the building or on balconies (this is actually a huge one for me as a non-smoker.... I hate the smell of cigarettes)
* Comcast as an optional internet provider (since I work for NBCUniversal and Comcast, I get free internet and cable; there's no way I would willingly pay another internet provider when I could just get free internet through my work)
* Bonus: an indoor swimming pool and hot tub (I love to swim, in fact, it's probably my most preferred sport, so having these as bonus amentities make living anywhere way more enjoyable)

So... I guess my requirements list has gotten even longer. But one huge thing I have learned is that you may find an apartment that's great, and then learn that it's not as great as you thought. It's okay to move when your lease is over. In fact, financially that may be the best option, if your rent is increasing by a significant amount for the next year.

### 3.

&gt; **SKIMP: tons of new clothes**. Call it luck that at my job, jeans and t-shirts are totally appropriate, but I never am willing to spend more than about $30 on a shirt or a pair of pants if I don‚Äôt have to. Stay away from the designer stores and expensive retail stores. I only buy expensive clothes when I know I‚Äôll be wearing them to a very important occasion.

This has pretty much stayed the same. But unfortunately, what ends up happening is that I end up buying such cheap clothing that it only lasts a year. I know that if I paid a bit more on a more expensive version, it would actually be better quality. But in my defense, I actually have raised my maximum price range of a piece of clothing to more like $50.

### 4.

&gt; **SPLURGE: eating at nice restaurants**. I don‚Äôt mean super pricey restaurants, just ones that aren‚Äôt fast-food chains. I would never skip on going out to eat with an old friend at a decently nice restaurant. Worst case scenario, I‚Äôm fed with good-tasting food, my wallet is $45 lighter, and I‚Äôve gotten some socializing done with friend(s). Could be worse. And I‚Äôll probably get leftovers out of it, too.

Recently, I've begun to switch up my diet in favor of healthy foods that are homecooked. I make simple, easy-to-remember recipes. But I've also learned that I can save a lot of money by not going out to eat. Cooking food at home is cheaper and healthier. I will say that eating a bunch of frozen meals will add up, so instead I've been opting for pasta, beans, rice, eggs, fresh fruit, and frozen veggies. Cheap and easy to cook!

### 5.

&gt; **SKIMP: tons of takeout and fast-food**. Although it doesn‚Äôt seem like much, a month‚Äôs worth of take out fees and fast-food adds up. I‚Äôd much rather cook one meal, and have it and its leftovers last me three days than spend $5-10 every two days on lunches.

Since my answer to #4 has changed, it makes sense that this one would stay very much the same. Unless I'm in a rush, fast food isn't really worth it. And McDonald's is way more expensive now than I feel like it was when I was younger. Now, a Big Mac is almost $5!

### 6.

&gt; **SPLURGE: Netflix**. Of course everyone will have different opinions about this, but for me, Netflix is a necessity. Almost right up there with internet. For me, Netflix can easily occupy 3 hours worth of time, and it is a good distraction from the rest of your life when you just need a break.

I completely agree on the Netflix debate as I did three years ago. In fact, now I use Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, the occasional Redbox DVD, and my internet provider's cable subscription to watch TV shows! Granted, I don't quite pay for all of these myself. I use my parents' Netflix still (that's a long story, but I'm still on strike‚Äîthank you Mom and Dad!), and my old friend's Hulu account. If I was paying for them myself, then I'd try to cut down some of these unless I was sharing the bill with a roommate or a significant other.

However, one tool I would totally recommend is the public library. If you're willing to wait a few months, then you should take advantage of that old library card you had when you were 12, and put some DVD's and TV shows on hold at the library! You'll most likely be waiting a while, but (assuming you have a DVD player), it's a convenient and free (!) way to watch DVDs and TV shows. Then, you just return it to the library when you're done (make sure to return on time to avoid late fees).

### 7.

&gt; **SKIMP: expensive phone bills with tons of unused data**. If you plan on getting Internet and WiFi at your apartment, like most people have, then you can skip on the data a little bit. For me, 5GB is plenty for the occasional watching of videos and browsing the web. But to each their own (some people use over 10GB a month, and I know that).

When it comes to phone bills, paying some amount of money for a phone bill is a given. But, the truth still stands that if your home and work have WiFi, then you most likely won't need a lot of data. These days, I use my phone for navigation more and more while driving, and I occasionally stream Apple Music in the car, so I need some data for that. But I probably don't use more than 4GB a month. Make sure to shop around for the cheapest plan you can get, and always jump at the chance to share your bill with roommates or SOs. Oftentimes, having one account with multiple phones is cheaper than each person paying individually.

### 8.

&gt; **SPLURGE: a good car**. Yes, my car was not cheap. I got a brand new Honda CR-V, with only 11 miles on it. The reason I got this car was because I think of it like an investment. If I bought a cheap car with 120,000 miles on it and it needed maintenance and new parts, then I spend the original amount on the car, plus gas, insurance, the maintenance, and parts. And, it could only last me 2-3 more years. But, if I buy a nice car that isn‚Äôt old and doesn‚Äôt need a lot of work, assuming I take proper care of the car, it could potentially last me 7 more years. And, I love my car.

I still stand by this belief. It's important to have a good car that will last. My car hardly needs maintenance (besides routine tire rotations, tire alignments, and oil changes), but not much more, because it's still so new. My coworker's car has been in the auto shop for the past week, just getting fixed up to driveable condition because it's much older.

However.... I got my car new.... and that's definitely not the most financially responsible thing to do. I should've gotten a used car that was a few years old. It still would've lasted just as long, and it would've been cheaper by about $5k. But, I opted for the newest safety features when I got my car, and those were only available in newer CR-V models.

The one other thing I'd recommend against is fixing your car up when you bump into something. Everybody gets some damage on their car eventually. Whether that's scratches, running into a pole in the parking lot, bumping your back bumper into a snowbank, etc. In my limited experience, paying the shop to fix it up is rarely worth it. There was one time where I ran into the back of a semi truck, and my passenger-side mirror cracked. Replacing that was worth it because I couldn't see out of it. That was affecting my ability to drive my vehicle.

But another time I ran into a pole in my parking garage at my apartment. And I paid to have parts of the rear moldings replaced. It cost about $450. And, I decided to leave some scratches in the paint because fixing those would be even _more_ expensive. But later that summer, my car fell victim to a hit-and-run in another parking lot. I did decide to get that fixed up (and my insurance deductible was a terrible $750). The only good news is that I convinced the auto shop to fix up the other scratches that were still remaining from the pole incident. In hindsight, I probably didn't need to spend $1,200 to fix my car up from those incidents. Neither of the accidents were affecting the drive of my vehicle, so they were all cosmetic. And if I didn't care about my car so dang much, I would've been fine leaving them the way they were.

Don't worry... I've switched my auto insurance now, so my deductible is lower.

&gt; **SKIMP: buying a couch right when I move out**. The truth is, when you first move out, there are some things you need. Some pots and pans, and a shower curtain fall under that list. There are also some things you don‚Äôt need right away. A couch and a TV are in that list. Couches are expensive. Besides the bed/mattress and the dining table/chairs, it‚Äôll be in the top 5 most expensive things you‚Äôll buy for quite a while (at least in terms of furniture). Therefore, skip the couch. If you‚Äôre a college student, you‚Äôre probably used to lying on your bed watching cute animal videos anyway, so you‚Äôll do just fine without a couch if you wait a couple months.

When I first moved out, I did buy a couch. But hold on before you go judging me. I used some money given to me by my aunt who had recently past away. If I was buying all of my furniture out of my own pocket, I would've skipped out on the couch. But, since my aunt past away earlier in the summer, she had left me and my sister a small amount of money. I decided to use that to furnish my new apartment, which my aunt would never see. I'm sure she's proud of the fact that my furniture was all the proper color scheme to match the apartment. I've moved a couple more times since, but every piece of furniture I bought transferred to the new apartments nicely.

And, it turns out that when you don't have any pets to chew up your cushions, your Ikea furniture can actually last a long time!

&gt; **SPLURGE: a good bed**. The thing with mattresses is, the better quality mattress you buy, the longer it‚Äôll last, the more comfortable it‚Äôll be, and the better you‚Äôll sleep. And hopefully you‚Äôll learn sometime in your adult life that sleeping is never something you should skimp on if you can help it.

Yes, yes, yes to this! I bought my bed and frame on sale for $1k from Macy's, and it was worth it. I love having a comfortable bed. Granted, now I know that I could've done a little more research to find a mattress that would've suited my sleeping needs more, but this one will do the trick, at least for the next 8 years or so.

Last week, for the first time in a couple of months, I felt the need to do more with my Jekyll website(s). GitHub Pages provides an opportunity to host as many sites as I wish, as long as their repository code is public and I'm okay with the resulting site being public. I wasn't really okay with that situation, so instead, I opted to look at GitHub Pro. GitHub Pro offered to host my GitHub Pages site on repositories that were private, which was basically exactly what I wanted. I know that GitLab Pages could provide me with that same setup for free, but my whole world is on GitHub, and I didn't quite feel the need to switch that up yet.

When it comes to having a private website though, neither GitHub Pages nor GitLab Pages offers that. So, I went to the handy-dandy Google for how to protect a GitHub pages site. I ended up finding &lt;a href='https://github.com/chrisssycollins/protected-github-pages' target='_blank'&gt;@chrisssycollins' repo _protected-github-pages_&lt;/a&gt;. Although the first Google result was actually basically the same thing (&lt;a href='https://github.com/matteobrusa/Password-protection-for-static-pages' target='_blank'&gt;@matteobrusa's _Password-protection-for-static-pages_&lt;/a&gt;), I found I liked the documentation in @chrisssycollins' version better than @matteobrusa's version. #SorryNotSorry. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. So, I'll acknowledge @chrisssycollins' version in my post and README.md instead üòâ.

As I started working on two new GitHub Pages sites I started to play around with the different Jekyll themes. It turns out that my original site (this one) was made so long ago that a decent amount about the themes have changed since then. Now, &lt;a href='https://github.com/pages-themes' target='_blank'&gt;@pages-themes&lt;/a&gt; manages most of the GitHub Pages themes (instead of the individual creators of the themes). They also do this thing where you can `@import {% raw %}{{ site.theme }}{% endraw %};` into the CSS files, assuming that the theme is set in the `_config.yml`. What this means is that new users of the themes don't need to copy-paste all of the CSS files if they just want _exactly_ the CSS settings of the original themes. This means that it's very possible that getting your GitHub Pages site up and running is fast... like super fast... like within-a-day-fast. In fact, both of my new GitHub Pages sites were running and live within a day.

What this also means is that, since none of the CSS is actually _in your repository_, when you want to make changes to the CSS (say edit the size of a button, change the font, etc), you need to go to the CSS source on GitHub, search in the entire repository for the piece that you need, and then copy-paste that entire element back to your repo and make the changes. To find exactly which piece of CSS required to make a change, I had to play a lot with using Chrome's Inspect option on my local site. Chrome's Inspect feature allowed me to find the exact value that I'd need to edit so I copy-pasted the proper CSS element into my local repository üòï. I'm sure that changing the themes' CSS pattern had good intentions, but I actually found it quite annoying. Perhaps the _most_ annoying part of this is that when running Jekyll locally, I got a petty warning about the `_includes/` directory not found in the source layout. Since I use the `_includes/` directory in every project, this was particularly irritating.

So instead, I went through each GitHub Pages repository I was using and copy-pasted _all_ of the CSS code into my own directory, and then removed the setting of `theme` in the `_config.yml`. Now there's a ton of CSS lines in my repos, but I don't really mind, especially if all of the CSS can now be in one condensed file and repository, instead of calling a bunch of other files/repos.

I also took the weekend to standardize all of the code that sources my sites, so the directory and file layout of them all match. I even made another site that has nice buttons that lists to each of my sites and their respective code. I also made that repo private and put in password protection. There's links to my other private site there, so I don't want people to figure out a way into the originally private site. So putting an extra password in for the new list of sites (that the world can't get to) is beneficial for me. (I should clarify that hackers could probably get in... I didn't put in top-notch security; even the example repos I used say that, but it's secure-enough ü§´).

The last thing I did this weekend was redo this site. I wanted to make the "About Me" and "Around Town" pages more user-friendly. I wanted to rethink who my audience of this site is... besides me and my mom. I realized that I wanted it to be easier for prospective employers to see information about me. So reading about my favorite books and TV shows, while debatably interesting, maybe isn't the best content for my "About Me" page. Instead, that should be my resume page. And then my "Around Town" page should look less bulletpoint-y and more section-y. I used &lt;a href='https://brianm.me/' target='_blank'&gt;@BrianMitchL's personal page&lt;/a&gt; as inspiration for what types of things I should be putting on mine. I still think that mine pales in comparison to his, but it's closer.

Oh... I also purchased my domain! üôåüèº. I had been hesitant to make the commitment of which domain to buy for a while (which is silly because I commit for a year when I sign my apartment contract annually), but I finally took the plunge and purchased my domain: `emmasax4.info`. Technically, I could've swapped out `.info` for `.com`, or `emmasax4` for just plain `emmasax`. But after a week of pondering what I wanted to choose, I realized that `4` is kind of my thing. My email has a 4. My Twitter has a 4. My GitHub has a 4. And of course, I did that all intentionally when I made those usernames (actually the email thing was just because `emma.sax@gmail.com` was already taken, and the rest came _after_ the email). So I figured that I might as well be intentional about my 4's and just make it happen with that! So in one night, I went through the work of setting up my DNS, hooking it all up into GitHub, and by the time I went to bed, I had my own websites hosted on GitHub Pages with custom domains and SSL.

Throughout my website "spike", I'd like to say that I learned a lot more about Jekyll. I learned more about how the Jekyll themes use CSS, I learned that a Jekyll theme is really just a bunch of CSS, and Jekyll itself is really just about the data structures and config files. I learned more about how the permalinks work. And I learned that Jekyll isn't really that magic üéâ... I could make my own Jekyll site by adding one file at a time, instead of selecting a specific theme in GitHub's Settings page. I learned more about DNS, and about hosting websites on custom domains. After all of this, I feel like I'm finally ready to take on the website world!
This was initially written in December of 2016, even if I'm publishing it in 2019. In a way, it was my first attempt at a blog post (just not on this blog). So, I thought it'd be interesting to document it here. Since writing this, some amount of my opinions on these ideas have changed a little bit. Stay tuned for an updated list coming soon üòâ.

There comes a point in most young adults‚Äô lives where they need to think about saving money. Whether they just graduated from college, just bought their first car, or are trying to save for a special occasion, it‚Äôs important to understand that money doesn‚Äôt grow on trees. There‚Äôs rarely a way for an average, middle-class 20-something-year-old to afford everything they‚Äôd like to have and have a reasonable savings account, too. Therefore, it‚Äôs up to the person to decide how they‚Äôd like to spend their money. Which usually involves a mixture of, what I call, "skimping" on things and "splurging" on things.

Here‚Äôs 10 things my list of "skimps" and "splurges":
1. **SKIMP: daily coffee**. In fact, I don‚Äôt drink any coffee at all. Call me lucky that I don‚Äôt need the pick-me-up of energy in the morning, but because of it, I can easily save $150 a month from frequent trips to Starbucks.
2. **SPLURGE: apartment rent**. Even though apartments provide a low-contract living situation, I like knowing that the place I‚Äôm living in is decently nice, in a good neighborhood, and I would feel comfortable living there for years to come if I wanted to. And it‚Äôs not like I was super picky. In fact, my requirement for living there included 6 things:
* Central heat
* Air conditioning
* Dishwasher
* Underground parking available
* Free laundry (does not necessarily mean in-unit washer/dryer)
* Fitness room in building
3. **SKIMP: tons of new clothes**. Call it luck that at my job, jeans and t-shirts are totally appropriate, but I never am willing to spend more than about $30 on a shirt or a pair of pants if I don‚Äôt have to. Stay away from the designer stores and expensive retail stores. I only buy expensive clothes when I know I‚Äôll be wearing them to a very important occasion.
4. **SPLURGE: eating at nice restaurants**. I don‚Äôt mean super pricey restaurants, just ones that aren‚Äôt fast-food chains. I would never skip on going out to eat with an old friend at a decently nice restaurant. Worst case scenario, I‚Äôm fed with good-tasting food, my wallet is $45 lighter, and I‚Äôve gotten some socializing done with friend(s). Could be worse. And I‚Äôll probably get leftovers out of it, too.
5. **SKIMP: tons of takeout and fast-food**. Although it doesn‚Äôt seem like much, a month‚Äôs worth of take out fees and fast-food adds up. I‚Äôd much rather cook one meal, and have it and its leftovers last me three days than spend $5-10 every two days on lunches.
6. **SPLURGE: Netflix**. Of course everyone will have different opinions about this, but for me, Netflix is a necessity. Almost right up there with internet. For me, Netflix can easily occupy 3 hours worth of time, and it is a good distraction from the rest of your life when you just need a break.
7. **SKIMP: expensive phone bills with tons of unused data**. If you plan on getting Internet and WiFi at your apartment, like most people have, then you can skip on the data a little bit. For me, 5GB is plenty for the occasional watching of videos and browsing the web. But to each their own (some people use over 10GB a month, and I know that).
8. **SPLURGE: a good car**. Yes, my car was not cheap. I got a brand new Honda CR-V, with only 11 miles on it. The reason I got this car was because I think of it like an investment. If I bought a cheap car with 120,000 miles on it and it needed maintenance and new parts, then I spend the original amount on the car, plus gas, insurance, the maintenance, and parts. And, it could only last me 2-3 more years. But, if I buy a nice car that isn‚Äôt old and doesn‚Äôt need a lot of work, assuming I take proper care of the car, it could potentially last me 7 more years. And, I love my car.
9. **SKIMP: buying a couch right when I move out**. The truth is, when you first move out, there are some things you need. Some pots and pans, and a shower curtain fall under that list. There are also some things you don‚Äôt need right away. A couch and a TV are in that list. Couches are expensive. Besides the bed/mattress and the dining table/chairs, it‚Äôll be in the top 5 most expensive things you‚Äôll buy for quite a while (at least in terms of furniture). Therefore, skip the couch. If you‚Äôre a college student, you‚Äôre probably used to lying on your bed watching cute animal videos anyway, so you‚Äôll do just fine without a couch if you wait a couple months.
10. **SPLURGE: a good bed**. The thing with mattresses is, the better quality mattress you buy, the longer it‚Äôll last, the more comfortable it‚Äôll be, and the better you‚Äôll sleep. And hopefully you‚Äôll learn sometime in your adult life that sleeping is never something you should skimp on if you can help it.

Well, I hope this list might help you as you begin to budget, make real money  for yourself, and figure out how you want to live your financial life. Thanks for reading!
A couple years ago, after I started working full-time, I thought about pursuing a second job. Perhaps something in retail or serving. I eventually decided not to go through with that‚ÄîI really didn't need the additional money, since I work full-time as a software engineer. But this past January, I decided to make a change and take a second job anyway.

The reasons why a person might decide to get a second (or third) job is usually related to money. If a person is having trouble paying the bills with their first job, they may get another one to cover the difference. But for me, I didn't necessarily _need_ a second job, I just _wanted_ one. Since I had decided to do my Kenya vacation in August (read more about that [here](/posts/welcome-to-kenya)), I figured that my savings account was going to take a significant hit if I didn't make up some of that money through another job.

## Working with &lt;a href="https://shoppers.instacart.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Instacart&lt;/a&gt;
### Full-Service Shopper

One of my friends works a second job at Instacart as a full-service shopper/deliverer. She really enjoys it, too. She gets off her 9‚Äì5 job, and then drives around to different grocery stores, shops, uses an Instacart-provided debit card to pay, and then delivers the groceries to customers. She gets paid based on each order (what Instacart calls a "batch"), and she receives tips. Some of the deliveries are at apartment buildings, and some are at houses. The idea of shopping for food without spending any of _my_ money appealed to me. So in late January, I applied to work as a full-service shopper for Instacart.

My first day on the job was really cold. This past winter, Minnesota had three days of extreme cold (think like ‚Äì40¬∞F). So my first day of working there was during one of these days. That first day involved a fair amount of delivery. On one of my orders, the customer had inputted the wrong address to deliver to, so the app tried to get me to drive 0 miles _back_ to the store to deliver the groceries instead of the customer's home. I ended up having to submit a reimbursement request and call the "Shopper Happiness" line to get a refund for that. Another order had the bags packed so heavy by an in-store shopper that at least two of the seven bags broke on their way to the door to the apartment complex. I had to stop and pick up spilled yogurt, milk, and orange juice on the freezing cold sidewalk. And another order on that day involved delivering to an apartment complex that included four flights of stairs‚Äîand the stairs were outside. After that first day, I'm not really sure why I wanted to keep doing full-service delivery... but yet I signed up for the next few shifts and I kept doing it.

I worked a variety of different regions/zones, including West Metro (Chanhassen, Shakopee, Eden Prairie, etc), Maple Grove (Maple Grove, Plymouth, Robbinsdale, Brooklyn Center, etc), and Minneapolis (Minneapolis, St. Louis Park, Golden Valley, etc). What I found was that the West Metro and the Maple Grove zones have the most driving involved. I remember once when I drove down to Shakopee to pick up a few bags for delivery, and then ended up driving all the way to Mound for the delivery. Approximately one hour of driving total, for just $15. If I don't want to drive as much, then I should take up shifts in the Minneapolis zone. The square mileage is less in the Minneapolis zone, so there's significantly less driving. However, there's clearly more traffic. I've done several deliveries that were in downtown Minneapolis. Having to drive downtown, sometimes during rush hour traffic, park in congested lots at grocery stores, and then find a place to park on the street (that doesn't cost money) so that you can run inside to deliver the groceries...... not particularly enjoyable.

Delivering in different zones also has different types of delivery locations. There's a lot more apartment buildings in the Minneapolis zone, including at the university campus. This can be bad because sometimes the customer will want you to walk all of the groceries to their apartment door. So you need to ring the building, wait to be let up, find the elevator (or just take the stairs), and then walk through the maze of the hallway until you find the right door number. If the customer doesn't answer to let you into the building, you need to sit there and wait for 10 minutes, and then call Shopper Happiness. One time this happened where I called about five times myself, and then had to call Shopper Happiness, who managed to contact the customer. When asked if the customer received any calls from me, they just said: "I've been here the whole time, but I never heard anything else." The only thought going through my head was "I'm not paid hourly... I'm paid by batch. So by wasting 40 minutes standing here waiting for you, I lost another potential $15".

Delivering in suburb zones has less apartment buildings which is nice. Houses are easier to find and locate. And if the customer doesn't answer the door, you can leave the groceries on the front step, and go back to your car to keep warm. However, I had to deliver to several houses where the customer didn't snowplow their driveway, or didn't do it well. Although that's not a huge deal in terms of parking the car, dragging the groceries to the front door can be difficult if the walkways are snow and ice covered. I'm just amazed that I only fell once.

I also want to mention that I banged my car up a couple times, and later paid to fix that, too. So even though we're paid per order, and we're paid mileage (from each grocery store to each delivery location, but NOT from a delivery location to the next grocery store), there was still a decent amount of wear-and-tear on my car. In one month of delivery driving, I drove 1,255.3 miles, and that's just working Instacart! I still drove to my 9‚Äì5 job each day, to run errands, etc.

Now I do want to make it clear that there were a few awesome batches. One of mine, that started as a bad one (hot deli food and about 80 pounds of cat litter), turned out to be a good one. The customer that answered the door was super nice. He told me that he doesn't leave his house at all, so he gets all of his groceries delivered to his door. Very pleasant, and it was clear he was very grateful. He also gave me a nice tip.

Another order took an unexpected turn when I kept all of the groceries. The food was decent, but when I went to deliver, the customer never came to pick up the order. I messaged the customer in my app, called the customer, stood there for 30 minutes, and nothing. When I called Shopper Happiness, they told me that the original store I bought the groceries from had closed for the night, so I couldn't return the items. So I could "dispose of them how I choose to". So... I kept the groceries. Since I'm vegetarian, I gave the meat items to my friend (the same one who got me started with Instacart), and I kept everything else that appealed to me. I think maybe we got about $70 of free groceries that night.

There were a couple apartment complexes that I went to multiple times, too (generally homes for the elderly). I've been to so many places around the western half of the Twin Cities that sometimes I'll even vaguely recognize a neighborhood, streets, or an area of town. There have been instances where my partner is driving, and we're going to place I've never been to before in Burnsville. But yet, I recognize many of the streets we're driving on, and I know that there's a HyVee nearby. Even though I only have been in that area once or twice before, when you're looking for a specific turn, you get used to the neighborhoods.

But after about a month, I started to get a bit sick of it... as you can probably imagine from my description of Instacart delivery. The weather was still pretty bad, traffic was bad, especially during rush hour, and I found that I wasn't a big fan of delivering to people. This was also made worse by the fact that only 50% of my customers would actually tip. It was also tiring. One week, I worked 29 hours. That's in addition to the 40 hour work-week I had worked at my full-time job. Other weeks, I worked between 16‚Äì24 hours at Instacart. I'd get home at 2pm after working 6 hours of Instacart on a Saturday, and I'd have to take a nap, much to my partner's dismay. I was putting so much time and energy into Instacart that it was affecting the rest of my life. So, in mid-March, I decided to switch from a full-service shopper to an in-store shopper.

### In-Store Shopper

There are pros and cons of being an in-store shopper versus a full-service shopper. In-store shoppers are paid an hourly rate of $14. They're technically employees, so they pay taxes straight out of their paycheck. They are scheduled on a weekly basis based on provided availability. They have bosses. They can be fired, and Instacart can give them rules and requirements they must follow. In-store shoppers also cannot deny a batch they receive. Full-service shoppers choose their own hours every week, and can pick up or drop hours without much prior notice. They are contractors, meaning they don't pay any taxes on their paycheck, and instead get the full amount every pay week. However, that backfires when at tax season, the contractor then has to pay the same taxes, plus the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/self-employment-tax-social-security-and-medicare-taxes#targetText=The%20self-employment%20tax%20rate,for%20Medicare%20(hospital%20insurance" target="_blank"&gt;self-employment tax&lt;/a&gt;.). Full-service shoppers don't have a dress code, and they can shop as fast or as slowly as they like. When I worked, they could also decline batches if it involved too much driving, was too heavy, involved store(s) they didn't like, etc.

The promise of not having to drive and getting "steady" pay enticed me. My car had gotten a beating when I was working full-service, and I was sick of driving all over the west suburbs in the cold, snowy, and icey weather (yes, I know that summer would eventually come, but that'd be shortly followed by another winter). Some other benefits of working in-store would be that I'd no longer need to back and forth between different outdoor and indoor temperatures, and if there was a spare moment where I didn't have a batch, at least I'd be sitting and relaxing inside, instead of in a running car. Also... the amount of times I had to go to the bathroom, but I had to hold it because there was no nearby bathroom üöΩüò¨...

When I switched to in-store shopping, I got to select which store I wanted to work at. I decided to work at a Cub Foods that was right in between my full-time job and my home. This made it easy to get there when I was coming from home, and easy to get there when I was leaving straight from my normal day job. They provided me with a t-shirt (eventually I got three t-shirts), a new lanyard, and walked me through the schedule.

The first thing I noticed was that having to wait until a computer-generated schedule came out was sometimes not fun. You don't know when you're planning to work the next week, and you get assigned hours based on availability, but if there's too many shoppers, then nobody gets the amount of hours they want. Sometimes when I requested 16 hours, I'd get assigned 8. Sometimes when I set myself to be available for 20, I'd get all 20, even if I _really_ only wanted 12.

Also, having so many rules wasn't always fun. They had speed goals, so we'd have to strive to shop for `X` amount of items in a certain amount of seconds (maybe around say 65 seconds per item). So that means if you have a three item order, you have to complete it in 3 minutes 15 seconds... yeah it's not really possible to shop for, select, and go through checkout for three items in 3 minutes. But yet, that was the goal. The speeds of all of your batches are averaged, so one slow batch doesn't throw everything off, but if you get a lot of small or time-heavy batches (think meat/deli counter, hard-to-find items, long checkout lines, etc), then your whole average will get skewed.

But, despite these complaints, the job started out as really fun. I got to socialize, talk to other workers, and get to know more people. In spare time, I could occasionally read a magazine at the store, or finish up my own personal shopping during a break. The store had something called "Sunday Funday", where the boss would buy the workers some snacks or cakes to eat during the shift. And, I was making the extra money I needed without doing much extra driving.

In terms of money, the biggest difference I found can be summarized like this: if you want to earn the most money as quickly as possible and don't mind driving, then full-service is your thing; if you don't want to drive, and you don't mind earning money more slowly, then in-store may work best.

I worked as an in-store shopper for several months. By mid-August (my trip was happening in August), I began to realize that I was almost done working Instacart. I was beginning to get tired of shopping for people and doing their chores. Some customers would be petty with me. Instacart started rolling out more rules around complete vs. incomplete deliveries. They lowered the speed goal. They decided to require all shoppers to use single bags instead of double bags (which means more bags per order). Other coworkers of mine weren't getting the amount of hours they needed/wanted. And most importantly, my health was starting to be affected.

I was eating out food so much more than before. I was spending money buying frozen meals for dinner instead of cooking food in my own home. I didn't have the time that I needed to get proper sleep each night, and I wasn't really getting any exercise. Also, I found that I wasn't taking the time that I needed to properly practice self-care. I worked between 45‚Äì65 hours a week for eight months, so I was burning myself out. Lastly, I felt like Instacart had sort of taken over my life; I was always thinking about Instacart, worrying about my performance, stressing out over schedules, etc. Given the fact that it doesn't give me a huge ratio of my income, it seemed like the stress it was causing me wasn't worth it.

So one month after returning from Kenya, I worked my last shift as an Instacart in-store shopper.

## What I Learned

It's hard for me to summarize what I've learned during this, but I'll do my best:
* It's hard to work more than 40 hours a week. I admire anybody that works more than 40 hours a week for any consistent amount of time. Oh, and nobody working that much should be struggling to pay their bills.
* People that are paid hourly are not lazy or unintelligent (I already knew this, but it was confirmed).
* Working physical jobs are super difficult (I sit on a computer at my full-time job).
* People have a second job for a variety of different reasons‚Äîdon't go thinking you know everyone else's reasons.
* Tipping is super important! People rely on tips to help make their living and earn a decent amount of money (I already knew this, too, but it was also confirmed). Every delivery person (eg: pizza delivery workers, Bite Squad deliverers, furniture deliverers, etc) deserve to get tipped, especially if they're using their own personal car to do the deliveries.
* You can't expect your deliverers to be able to read your mind. You've got to give them strict instructions about directions, what foods to pick out, what to substitute with, etc, otherwise you've just gotta understand that they don't know exactly what you want because THEY'RE NOT YOU.
* If you're getting a service or item delivered to you, you should either be there to receive it, or you should tell them they can just drop it off. It's actually pretty rude to ask for delivery between the hours of 5‚Äì6pm and then just not be there or not answer the door. Considering each driver then has to wait for you to arrive... yeah you totally just disrespected that person's time and money (delivery people are people, too).
* The gig economy doesn't always pay their contractors fairly.
* Any person that uses their car for their work should be tipped kindly and paid fairly for that mileage and gas.
* And most importantly: people that work part-time are people, too. And they don't deserve to be blamed, yelled at, or their pay to be docked for just doing their best.

## Conclusion

By the time I finished working with Instacart, I earned approximately an extra ~$5,700. However, I ran into the conundrum where even though I intended to save that money for my trip to Kenya, I just ended up spending additional money as well as my Kenya trip. The more money I made, the more I felt entitled to spend. But at the end of the day, I'm so grateful for the opportunity to work the second job to help bolster my savings account. Because of Instacart, I was able to fund a once-in-a-lifetime vacation without really denting my savings account. I managed to meet new friends, get to socialize, and most importantly, have new experiences and new knowledge about the working economy and society in the U.S. But if I'm completely honest, I'm not sure I'll work a second job if I can help it ever again. Burnout at work is real.

NOTE: I did keep detailed records of the miles I drove, the money I made, the hours I worked, and the batches I completed if you're interested.
Although our last day in Kenya was chaotic, it was also saddening. We had all gotten so close to the people in our van, to our other travellers with us (even the people not in our van), and to our driver. One of the stops we made on our way to the airport was at a gas station ‚õΩÔ∏è. Although our intention was to gather all of the trucks, we also used the opportunity to say goodbye to our drivers.

The day we met our drivers, they all stood in a line, and we got to hear their names and a tiny bit about them. Now, for the last time, we'd get to see our drivers once more stand in a line to say their goodbyes. I'm sure they're used to saying goodbye to tourists like us; their schedules are full of various travel companies and tourists. But, no matter how many times I say goodbye to someone in this situation, I'm always sad.

We hurriedly gave the last of our Kenya Shilling cash to our drivers as tips üí∞ and gave all of the drivers hugs goodbye‚Äîwe were running late and didn't want to be any later. And with that, we filed back into our trucks for the last time (except that one time at the airport through the security station). Even now, it's strange for me to think that there's new tourists having an adventure in the same seats in the same truck that we were in before.

When we got to the airport, our trip leaders were right; it was busy. We didn't have time to hug our drivers one last time, so instead, we pushed our way to the long lines that awaited us inside the airport doors. Kwaheri, Kenya üëãüèº.

&lt;/div&gt;

The above picture is of our van on our last day. In it we have Abdi (our driver), Impreet, Myra, Kristen, Andrew, and Jesse as our "photographer". Even over a month later, there's still a part of me that misses them üò¢.

Even though the plane ride was long, I don't remember a lot of it. I watched some movies and I slept üò¥.... I guess that's all the important stuff. But I do remember that after we landed, all 40 of us travellers were swept up in the hustle and bustle of customs. We all separated into different lines based on Global Entry, Mobile Passport, and the normal line. Some of us stopped in the restroom and others didn't. Briefly, we ran into a few people from our trip while waiting to get our luggage, but most of us were eager to find our connecting flight and move on to the next terminal.

We said goodbye to our trip leader after collecting our luggage. Similar to the drivers, I'm sure our leader was used to being with people one moment, and then not see them again. For me, it was bittersweet, saying goodbye to everyone. To pretty much everyone else, it seemed, it felt completely normal.

If I'm completely honest, I don't even remember the rest of the journey home. Maybe it's because I'm writing this a month later, and maybe it's because all of the exciting parts of the trip were done. All I know is that after we finally landed in MSP, my partner took a long nap while I put laundry in, washed some of the backpacks, and tidied up, just like it was before. Welcome home üè†.

---

One month later, all 40 of us still have a Facebook page together. We occasionally tag each other in posts, and we sometimes share articles we read that relate to the animals we saw or to Kenya. Just today I shared a funny post about how dangerous hippos are (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NomeDaBarbarian/status/1169598786777169921?fbclid=IwAR2pkUCtOIlyDhS6rFVaHNR3A2hnO5TdkmTHtIqYYzIqe4q1_yhoSRXhGd8" target="_blank"&gt;see the post here&lt;/a&gt;). But in general, most of our lives have continued on as normal. We all go back to our normal jobs, we post our normal pictures, and life goes on. I'm sure our trip leader is off on their next tour, and I bet Abdi is driving around the savanna with a new crew of adventurers in his truck. But, I won't forget the last thing Abdi said to us before we left: "Don't forget, you'll always have a friend in Kenya üá∞üá™. If you ever come back, just give us a call üìû."
At the end of the trip, we ended in the Maasai Mara, approximately six hours away from Nairobi. So, we had a long day of travel ahead of us to start our journey home. But, our trip planners didn't want to have a boring last day, so they planned a few extra stops. Here's what our original itinerary for the day looked like:
* 8:30am ‚Äì Optional activity (morning game drive, short game drive + Maasai village visit, sleeping in, etc)
* 12pm ‚Äì Meet for lunch at a mall between Maasai Mara and Nairobi
* 5pm ‚Äì Meet at Carnivore Kenya for a dinner buffet
* 8pm ‚Äì Arrive at Nairobi International Airport
* 10:50pm ‚Äì Our flight to JFK departs üõ´

However, hardly anything we planned actually came to fruition. And here's why...

## The Optional Activity

At 8:30am, we loaded up our safari trucks for the last time. However, this time, we split up into different groups than we normally did. My partner and I were separated for the first time during the trip, as he decided to go on a morning-long game drive, and I opted to do a half game drive + half village visit. You can read more about the Maasai village visit [here](/posts/welcome-to-kenya/2019-09-26-the-cuisine-and-the-lodging). Instead, my safari truck filled with two other travellers in our group, and we left the Fig Tree Camp.

While on this safari, we did manage to see several more animals, including a pack of cheetahs (which is rare, since cheetahs are usually solitary animals). About halfway through the game drive, we left and continued to the Maasai village. While at this village, I did have a unique experience where I asked where I could go to the bathroom, and one of the members of the village started leading me away from the rest of the group. I originally thought they were just leading me to a secluded bush, but as we continued walking farther and farther away from the rest of the group, I was a bit concerned that I might be kidnapped. But eventually (after walking through a poop-filled pasture), the man led me to a locked metal hut. This "washroom" was really just a hole in the ground, with a metal slab that we could use to scoop and shovel üí© with. All-in-all, it was very kind of the man to take me to use the restroom, since it was so far away, but I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't a little nervous about the whole ordeal.

I did manage to make it back to the safari trucks in time to leave with the rest of the group, and actually, with plenty of time to spare. Another traveller from our group, whom we ended up calling a "mini-shopaholic", was busy trying to make a special purchase. One of the items the Maasai village uses in their ceremonies and day-to-day life is a special horn made out of elephant tusk (or rhino tusk.... I don't quite remember). Our fellow traveller decided it'd be a good idea to try to buy it from them. After about 10 minutes of negotiating with the village‚Äîand holding up the safari trucks‚Äîhe ended up being able to almost make the sale for about $250üí∏üí∏üí∏. However, one of our safari drivers decided to intervene before the actual sale took place. The driver figured that it would be risky to try to bring back protected wildlife through the airport; he was nervous that our friend wouldn't be able to bring it home. Poor guy... even I think that would've been a really cool souvenir to bring back to the states.

On our way out of the Maasai Mara, we had to pass through the national park gated entrance. We decided to stop to use the restroom quickly (I wish I had known that we would stop about 20 minutes earlier). But as we opened the door to let a few of us out, we were bombarded with village women trying to sell us their beads and crafts. We ended up shutting the windows because they kept trying to talk to us. They'd stick their hands in the doorways to get the items closer to us, and none of us wanted to buy anything. Eventually, our truck driver had to _get out of the truck_, go up to them, and shoo them away in Swahili. We were grateful to our driver at that moment, because it can be intimidating having people in your face trying to get you to buy things.

But sooner or later, we left the Maasai Mara, and were on our way to lunch. The only thing was, we were running about 45 minutes late. Which normally wouldn't have been a huge deal. Except for the rest of the day happened...

## Lunch

While on the safari truck drive to find lunch, I found myself really needing to use the bathroom... again... I think I must've drank a lot of water at breakfast. I ended up managing to look up the exact shopping mall we were stopping at on Google (thanks Google Maps!). I used that as a reference to know when I would be free to run into the bathroom. Unfortunately... I couldn't make it the two hours to the mall. We had to stop on the side of the road to go to the bathroom (which we call "checking the tire"). I only felt bad because I knew we were running late already, and we were only stopping the whole truck for one person, but when you gotta go, you gotta go üöΩ.

So, now we're back on the road... running one hour late. As we approach the lunch spot, our group leader leans back and says "Since we're running late, let's only do a half hour lunch. We need to get back on the road to make it back to Nairobi by 5pm." We all nod in agreement... all of us (except vegetarian me) have been looking forward to Carnivore Kenya since we arrived 13 days ago.

As we pull up to the mall to stop for lunch, hungry and needing to get out to stretch, we head into the only restaurant in the whole mall to meet up to the rest of the group. The rest of the safari trucks are all already sitting inside, waiting for their food. They then inform us that the wait for the food at this restaurant is **_very_** slow. AKA, they ordered their food 25 minutes ago, and are still waiting... some are still waiting for just a cup of coffee.

So, my safari truck heads upstairs to the grocery store to grab a bite to eat. The good news about the grocery store is that the food in Kenya is super cheap compared to the U.S. I ended up getting a roll and fries from the hot deli (there's not much at a hot deli for a vegetarian in Kenya), and I also grabbed a bag of popcorn as a snack (since I'm vegetarian, I was a tad bit nervous about the food selection at _Carnivore_ Kenya). All of that cost about $3.50. In fact, the cashier asked me if I had any smaller bills. Oh... and the checkout lines in Kenya are _very_, _very_, _very_ long. I waited for about 12 minutes in the checkout line behind two people, and neither of them had very many items.

By the time I got back to the safari truck, we had just hit the 30 minute mark. However, I was one of the prompt ones back to the truck. We ended up having to wait for several other people who were still in the grocery store, and for a group of others to finish paying in the restaurant. My partner said that his food did eventually arrive, but it was cold ü•∂. Others said that their food never arrived at all, meaning that they missed lunch entirely.

The worst part of all of this is that in Kenya, as soon as you order, you're expected to pay (unlike in America where if your food never arrives, you don't really need to pay for it). So, as the safari trucks started to leave, a couple of the restaurant employees ran out demanding that we finish paying for our food. Once again, one of our safari drivers saved the day and finished paying off everybody's tab.

And so, with all of the restaurant bills paid, and now running nearly an hour and a half late, we continued our drive to Nairobi.

## The Drive to Nairobi

While we were on our lunch break, our drivers were informed that there was a hold-up on the road back to Nairobi which was causing a fair amount of traffic. Unlike in Minnesota, where you just take a detour route, and it only adds 20 minutes to your commute, there's not a lot of other options in Kenya. To be exact, there was exactly one other detour route. And _everyone_ decided to take it.

So while we passed through Lake Naivasha (which was at least an hour out of the way minimum), we hit terrible traffic. And I mean awful. Someone else in our truck compared it to traffic in India. For context, here's a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/BqOLehUdqkU?t=335" target="_blank"&gt;Youtube video of some driving in India&lt;/a&gt;. The traffic in Kenya was _worse_ than that. In order for our driver to turn right in any sane amount of time, he actually had to veer into the left lane, and then turn right from there.... that's pretty crazy to me.

There was another time where there was so much traffic that a bunch of cars were veering off the road, onto the grass and mud, and then onto the pedestrian path to drive instead. We saw cars getting stuck in the mud and driving in reverse to get off the insanely busy road. In order for our trucks to all stay together, there was one time where another driver of ours _got out_ of the truck, and walked over to ours... he was walking faster than our cars were moving. There were moments where a couple of the trucks' walkie-talkies got disconnected, and the safari truck drivers had to call the others on the phone just to try to stay communicating. We had to drive on the shoulders, the "sidewalks", and the grassy sides of the roads just in order to keep moving forward.

To summarize the horrible traffic, what should've been a four hour drive (for that portion of the trip) ended up taking six hours. And as we kept going, our estimated time of arrival to Carnivore Kenya kept getting pushed back farther and farther into the evening. There was an hour where we were concerned whether we could even make our flight back to the U.S. We were advised not to check-in to our second flight (in my case, JFK to MSP), just because we weren't sure if we were going to make it.

Eventually, our trip guide had to call Carnivore Kenya and tell them that we wouldn't make it. Then, the members of my truck had to message the other trucks and break the news that we wouldn't get dinner. All except me, because I had purchased that extra bag of popcorn üçø(also because I had 40 granola bars üç´ in my bag, but that's another story).

As we got closer to the city, we grew more confident that we'd make our flight to JFK on time. It turned out that by skipping dinner, we could make it to the airport right when we had planned to... yay‚ùìü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. We did need to make a few more pit stops before reaching the airport though. One of them was on the south side of Nairobi. The neighborhood we stopped in sort of sketchy, so our driver escorted us to the washroom, which was really just _disgusting_ holes in the ground... like really bad. I won't remember that pit stop fondly. Then, we stopped on the shoulder of the highway to gather all of our groups' trucks together. We wanted to make sure we were all on the same page before proceeding because the NBO (Nairobi International Airport) can get a bit chaotic...

## The Airport

The Nairobi International Airport has a bunch of security leading up to the gates. Apparently, they had some guns that were brought in in previous years, and they wanted to avoid that. As we approached the airport, we all had to get out of the trucks, and walk through metal detectors. I'm assuming our trucks were searched separately in a long line, because we then met up with the trucks at the other end of the gates.

We climbed back in the trucks and continued to the dropoff point. By the time we got there, all of our trucks were completely separated. We all filed out and went to retrive our bags. But, then we learned that the truck that my partner's bag was in had broken down in Lake Naivasha. Apparently, a few of our other safari trucks had gone back to pick up all the people and bags in those trucks (resulting in a couple of _very packed_ safari trucks), but that meant that we had no idea where my partner's bag was. We ran around for a couple minutes, until eventually we managed to locate it in some pile of our unclaimed bags.

Once we got to the door of the airport, we faced another round of security and metal detectors. We had to show our passports, screen our bags, and walk through metal detectors. Then, we went to the check-in line. Kenya Airways didn't really let any of us check-in for the flight ahead of time, so we all had to do it there. At this point, we're all sweaty, wearing our dirty safari clothes, and starving (except me, remember the üçø?). As we waited in the long check-in line, we began to realize that it wasn't just grocery checkout lines that take forever........ it must be _all_ Kenyan lines.

We arrived to the airport at 8:20pm. We didn't get through the check-in line until 9:30pm. Then, after checking our bags, we had to proceed to the next round of security. This one didn't include metal detectors, but instead was just a screening person where we handed our boarding passes and our passports. We stood in that line for another 20 minutes. Then we proceeded to the next round of security upstairs... I know, right üò®? It was at this part of security where all of the people that accidentally had dangerous souvenirs in their bags (such as daggers, knives, and spears) got stopped. Luckily, my partner and I scooted right through... we took the hour long wait downstairs as the opportunity to make sure our carry-on bags were security-ready.

Lastly, we made our way to the gates. Once we got there, most of us really wanted/needed to use the bathroom üöΩ(I never knew the need to pee could cause us so many issues in one day!). After waiting to use the three-stall restroom, it was about 10:10pm, and our flight boarded at 10:20pm. So, in a rush, we made our way to the _LAST_ round of security‚Äîthe final metal detectors and passport/ticket check before the gate. At this point, the security had to stop a couple more people with sketchy souvenirs, and physically open and search each of our backpacks. By the time I finally got through, the waiting area of the gate was packed, and there was no point in finding a seat... you're about to board in five minutes.

## Conclusion

By the time we all got seated on the flight and were getting ready to leave, I was as content as middle-of-the-middle-seat could be. Although the past 12 hours had been stressful and insane, we all made the flight on time, managed to change into comfier and cleaner clothes, and were just fine. And as a bonus, only a couple of (debateably irresponsible) people had their souvenirs taken away by security.

Well, the "we were just fine" opinion is purely my perspective... we can't forget that everyone else was starving... except for me... üçø, remember?
## Overall

## Nairobi ‚òû &lt;a href="http://www.tamarindtree-hotels.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Tamarind Tree Hotel&lt;/a&gt;

Tamarind Tree Hotel was by far the nicest place we stayed at in Nairobi. It was colorful üåà, clean üßº, the food was delicious, and the staff was pleasant. The entire hotel felt very safe, as there were security measures everywhere.

When we arrived, there was a gate at the entrance with guards. After letting our trucks in, we were surprised to find there was a metal detector at the main entrance, which everybody had to go through before entering the actual hotel. Even all of our bags had to be scanned by an x-ray machine (like TSA at the airport).

To take an elevator to any floor (besides the ground floor), you needed to have a keycard for that specific floor. I appreciated the extra feeling of security, even if it was somewhat irritating when you wanted to visit another room on a different floor.

The shower was interesting‚Äîit was just a glass door (which you could see the showerer's head through), and the tile floor was the same as the tiles in the rest of the bathroom. By the way, the bathroom didn't even have a door! So it felt very exposed. It was fine when I was sharing a room with somebody I knew well, but it would've been more awkward if I was rooming with someone I had just met.

The beds were small (twin sized), but comfortable, especially since we had just come off of a long flight üõ©.

The food was delicious. However, the buffet meal (we were all on our own for dinner) cost around $30, or 3,000 KSH. Therefore, I ended up ordering some spaghetti and bruschetta (and my partner ordered some steak or something) from the normal menu. But, when I asked how the buffet was, everybody said it was delicious and worth the $30 to them. To each their own ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Unfortunately, my group didn't get any pictures of Tamarind Tree Hotel, but you can check out their website online (linked above).

## Aberdares County ‚òû &lt;a href="https://thearkkenya.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Ark&lt;/a&gt;

The Ark was certainly the most unique place we stayed. The entire hotel/resort was designed to be like Noah's Ark, where the building is shaped like a boat. At the front (bow), there's four decks, and each one has an amazing view of a watering hole. A couple of the decks are actually outside, and this provides an amazing experience of the animals without glass‚Äîbut be very quiet, or else the animals will get scared üôÄ!

During the day, the watering hole and surrounding area has hyenas, buffalo, and warthogs. At night, the elephants come out, and stay for hours eating the nutrients (that are meticulously placed) in the dirt, and playing.

The rooms are small, but that's by design. They feel cozy and snug. The hallways are a maze, but you only need to know how to get to a few places: your room, the entrance/exit, the decks, and the restaurant (but you can get to the food from the decks).

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

The air was a bit chilly at night (because of the higher altitude in the mountains), but the staff brought warm hot water packs to each bed at night, so our tootsies stayed nice and cozy.

Like Tamarind Tree Hotel, the food here was scrumptious. The breakfast had a made-to-order omelet bar, fresh juice, potatoes, eggs, fruit, rolls, and everything in between. Yum yum yum!

## Samburu ‚òû &lt;a href="https://www.sarovahotels.com/shabalodge-samburu/" target="_blank"&gt;Sarova Shaba Game Lodge&lt;/a&gt;

The first thing we noticed about Sarova Shaba Game Lodge was that it was beautiful. The grounds were spectacular. There were man-made ponds with coi fish, man-made rivers to make us feel like we were out in nature, baboons and monkeys, large turtles in the rivers, crocodiles with a special crocodile watch area, a pool, gym, and plenty of space to relax at the resort. It was bright and open.

The suites themselves were arranged in little buildings with four suites in each building‚Äîtwo on the ground floor and two on top. The staff warned us to always bolt the doors because there was no latch, and so if they weren't bolted, then little primates could push their way inside the door and steal food or shiny things. One of my friends even forgot to bolt the door, and had a run-in with a baboon that decided to join them inside! My friends' roommate managed to scare the baboon off by flicking a whip at it, but we're still not exactly sure what he wanted inside that room.

The food was incredible. From our first buffet meal, it was clear that their food was superior. They had pasta at every meal, rice, vegetables, bread, meat, and an entire section of desserts. I'm not a huge dessert person myself, so I didn't really try any, but everyone else I travelled with enjoyed the dessert bar immensely.

They provided an array of extra activities we could do. Our tour guide set up a happy-hour for us that was hosted by the resort. We all went "into the bush", and they provided live Kenyan music, a guest from a Samburan tribe to talk to us about his village and his life, wine, cocktails, and appetizers. They had a cook who was also very good at photography, and he took several of us down to a river nearby to take some pictures of the setting sun.

I don't have many pictures of the exterior of Sarova Shaba Game Lodge, and that's really a pity; the best thing about this resort was the beautiful resort grounds. But, the good news is that their website has plenty of pictures featuring the resort grounds. Here's one picture of our room and one of the buffet line:

&lt;/div&gt;

### The Samburu Village Visit

Unrelated to the lodging and food, we also took the time to visit a native Samburu village. We learned many things about the native tribes of Samburu. If I recall correctly, there are around 42 Kenyan tribes still in existance, and the Samburu people are one of them. They live in several villages.

The boys become warriors around age 15, after a circumcision ceremony. Then, around 25-30, they'll become junior elders. It is around this age they can marry. A warrior can marry any amount of women (who are at least 18), but the number they marry is dependent on the livestock they have (warriors determine their wealth and power based on their livestock). Each woman will have their own hut, where they'll raise their children. The husband chooses which wife's hut they'll stay in each night, and that wife is responsible for feeding the husband for the night. Around age 40, then a junior elder becomes an elder.

Children do attend school... now. In school, young children will learn Swahili and English (the two official languages of Kenya), and they'll potentially learn more languages that are tribe-specific.

Women and mothers take care of the children, take care of the livestock, do beading and art projects, and sell their crafts to visitors and other tribes. We even got the chance to purchase some of their handmade jewelry and crafts.

## Ol Pejeta ‚òû &lt;a href="https://www.serenahotels.com/serenasweetwaters/en/default.html" target="_blank"&gt;Sweetwaters Serena Camp&lt;/a&gt;

Ol Pejeta's Sweetwaters Serena Camp was my favorite place we stayed. It's a tented camp, which means each suite is a full tent. However, it's not the types of tents that you'd think of when it comes to camping. These tents are on solid tile/wood/brick bases, have solid roofs, and have full bathrooms inside of them, including a toilet, shower, and sink. The tents were clean and well-kept. Take a look at the inside of one of the tents!

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
  &lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/184539266@N08/48796885958/in/album-72157710860887528/" target="_blank" title="sweetwaters"&gt;&lt;img class="my-image" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48796885958_594a93b9e1.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="sweetwaters"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/184539266@N08/48872252992/in/album-72157710860887528/" target="_blank" title="Sweetwaters_tent"&gt;&lt;img class="my-image" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48872252992_3ddc673f1b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Sweetwaters_tent"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The walk from the main resort buildings to the tents was also quite relaxing and beautiful. We even saw a strange bird land on the resort, as well as a couple of small gazelles.

All of the resorts had very similar type of food, but one super cool thing that Sweetwaters Serena Camp did was they had a made-to-order pasta bar at lunch and dinner. They provided several options of types of pastas, several types of sauces, and then each person could select their own vegetables to mix with the pasta. It was very yummy üçù!

Sweetwaters Serena Camp is on the Equator. No joke, the sign at the entrance gave the latitude and longitude‚Äîlatitude was 00.00:

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
  &lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/184539266@N08/48802026607/in/album-72157710860887528/" target="_blank" title="Sweetwaters Serena Camp"&gt;&lt;img class="my-image" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802026607_8bb9580f56.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Sweetwaters Serena Camp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

So, walking around in direct sunlight was a bit hot. However, as the night came, the air cooled off to a chilly 55¬∞F. However, it wasn't too cold for my Minnesota tendencies, and I was just fine without a jacket.

That is... until we went for the night game drive. One of the add-ons that I chose to do was night game drive that the resort provided. Read more about that excursion [here](/posts/welcome-to-kenya/2019-09-16-the-game-drives). I did get a bit chilly on that adventure, with the chilly, blowing wind (my fault... I had a jacket in the tent and just didn't bring it with me on the game drive).

The other amazing thing about Sweetwaters Serena Camp is the view. Most of our tents were right along a super long fence, and on the other side of the fence was a watering hole with lots of animals. From the entrance to our tent, it just felt like we could see so far on the horizon, and we could see so many buffalos and elephants. It was truly beautiful and extremely peaceful. Feel free to check out more about Sweetwaters Serena Camp at their website ‚òùüèº, and take a look at some of their rad pictures in the gallery.

## Lake Naivasha ‚òû &lt;a href="https://www.sopalodges.com/lake-naivasha-sopa-resort/the-resort" target="_blank"&gt;Sopa Resort&lt;/a&gt;

Our afternoon in Lake Naivasha was designed to be relaxing. Although we did go on a hippopotamus-viewing boat ride, once we actually got to the resort, we just hung out for the rest of the afternoon.

The Sopa Resort, where we stayed, featured a (very) long walk from the main resort to the cabins, and we took that opportunity to get some exercise. To provide a little bit of context, there were four suites per cabin structure (two on the ground floor, and two on the top floor), and there were 82 suites. However, the entire walk was delightful! It was completely paved, and each cabin looked exactly like the one next to it, which made them seem very cookie-cutter.... I actually liked that. It probably helped that my partner and I actually stayed in suite #2, so we never _needed_ to walk a long distance.

The only truly awesome thing about the cuisine at Sopa Resort (that made it stand out), was that it was my birthday the night we stayed there. Our trip leader must've mentioned that it was my birthday to the staff, because they brought out a cake for me, and all of the staff did a "congo" line and they sang a native Kenyan song (which featured the words "hakuna matata") to celebrate my birthday. The chocolate cake was _really_ good, too.

One famous thing about the Sopa Resort is that they're known for having hippopotamuses out grazing during the night. During the day, hippos lay in and around water to keep cool. But at night, they come out and graze on grass. Although there is a fence between the cabins and the "wild", the hippos step right over the fence to get more grass! Rumor has it that just last year, a tourist died because he tried to go up to a hippo to get a picture. So, Sopa Resort was our first experience where we had to be "escorted" back to our cabins at night.

Essentially, any time between when the sun sets and 7am the next morning, the resort recommends visitors be escorted back to their cabiins. This is for the visitors' safety; if the visitors come across a hippo or other animals, then the security guards can take care of the visitors and potentially try to scare away the animals. Except hippos... you just back up slowly and carefully and wait for the hippo to leave (they're dangerous). At first, this wasn't so bad, until we realized that whenever you receive an escort, you need to tip the security guard... hence one of the reasons why we spent so much on tips on this trip üíµ.

However, if you're lucky, your cabin windows (or deck on a top floor), gives you a beautiful chance to see some hippos out of the water. My partner and I stayed up trying to look for the hippos, and we even got up periodically in the middle of the night just to look out the windows to see if we could see anything. But we weren't so lucky. It was nice that our suite provided us a little couch to sit on while we gazed out the windows though:

## Maasai Mara ‚òû &lt;a href="https://www.maasaimara.com/entries/fig-tree-camp" target="_blank"&gt;Fig Tree Camp&lt;/a&gt;

Fig Tree Camp in the Maasai Mara was the last place we stayed. Fig Tree Camp is another tented camp, and unfortunately we weren't able to get a picture of our tents at this location. However, the fascinating thing about this resort was that the paths to get from one were lined with bones. I'm sure that locals just pick up random bones they find out on the savanna and bring them back to the resort. They had buffalo skulls, spines, an elephant skull, and more!

But if I'm completely honest, the thing I'll remember most about Fig Tree Camp was the walk from the main resort shelter to our tent. We were at tent 47. Our tent was so far away that the first employee we asked to escort us to the tent didn't know where it was‚Äîhe needed to ask another employee. Our tent was so far away that the stone-paved path eventually disappeared and became a dirt path. Our tent was so far away that we could visibly tell there were less lights indicating our path as we went on. Our tent was so far away, that we got lost trying to find it‚Äîtwice. And we were following signs! Sometimes, I felt like that walk was a mile long.

However, one cool thing was that all of the tents were almost completely surrounded by a long, curving river. In this river, hippos and crocodiles hang out. Twice we decided to tip a security guard extra to take us to the other side of the tents to try to view the hippos. We did indeed see about five hippos (including babies), and at least one crocodile sitting on the side of the river. They did make a few noises, but my partner and I didn't stick around long enough to hear a lot of them. But other travellers in our group claimed that the hippo song came on at about 5am each morning (promptly waking up all nearby tents). They also told us that security guards were pacing around the tents all night, listening for any strange noises or any indication that a primate may have gotten into a tent. So maybe our tent was far away, but at least we got a good night's rest ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Like some of the other resorts, Fig Tree Camp also offered a special excursion: a sunrise hot air balloon ride over the bush. Of course my partner and I did it! It was our first hot air balloon ride, too. We woke up at the crack of dawn (actually more like 5:30am), and made our way to the center of the resort at 6:30am. After the balloon ride completed (yes, we did see animals playing, walking, and relaxing), we finished the morning with a buffet breakfast, champagne, and mimosas on the bush (provided by the resort).

Oh, the last thing I'll mention about Fig Tree Camp: they had limited times the power and hot water was on. The power was on in the morning and afternoon/evening, and the hot water ran in the morning (from maybe 6am-9am), and in the evening (approximately 6pm-9pm). I know because the morning of the hot air balloon ride, I took an ice-cold shower.

&lt;/div&gt;

### The Maasai Village Visit

On our last day before heading home, we got the opportunity to visit one more Kenyan tribe: the Maasai tribe. To me, the two tribes look very similar, although I'm sure they would beg to differ. I will say that they don't wear the same types of clothes, and they style their hair and jewelry differently. The Samburu tribe wear a variety of different colored fabric and have shorter hair. The Maasai tribe wear primarily red fabric, have longer hair, and wear more earrings and long necklaces.

Similarly to the Samburu tribe, the Maasai tribe's boys become warriors around age 15, after a circumcision, and a ritual (which in the past usually involved killing some dangerous creature, such as a male lion). Women are married around 20, and warriors become elders around age 45. Warriors can marry multiple women, depending on livestock, power, and status. But there were a few other differences as well.

The Samburu tribe lives in huts made out of pieces of metal, fabric, and wood. The Maasai tribes make their homes out of branches and animal excrement, so it almost looks like real walls (excpet I didn't touch them). Both homes require adults to crouch down, and their doors are narrow‚Äîsometimes so narrow that we Americans had to sneak in sideways to avoid brushing the walls. In the Maasai tribe, what side of the home the door is on indicates what number wife made the home: a husband's first wife's door is on the left, the second wife's door is on the right, and then all of the husband's other wives' houses follow in a line from there, with each door on the right. The Maasai tribe said the first wife is usually chosen for status and money. The second, third, and so on are all chosen based on "love" or romantic interest.

Also, the Samburu village was just a bunch of huts in a scattered area. But the Maasai village's homes were actually in a full circle, with a big open space in the middle. Between each home is a fence, which they actually shut at night. At night, the village brings all of their livestock inside the circle to protect it from predation and escaping. However, what that means is that the entire village's ground is covered in animal (usually cow) excrement. There wasn't even a point to trying to avoid stepping on it; it was just everywhere. The Samburu village, by contrast, felt much cleaner.

The last thing I'll mention is that both tribes do a type of ceremonial activity where the boys/warriors will jump vertically in the air. A woman decides which man is a good suitor based on how high he can jump‚Äîthe higher the better. While watching an example ceremony take place, we also learned that the men in the Maasai tribe don't wear underwear underneath their clothes... don't ask us how.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, we stayed in some incredible resorts in Kenya. They were definitely for the "luxury-safari-traveller", and we enjoyed every minute of our stays. The food kept us fulfilled and ready for adventure, and we managed to get a sound night's sleep each night (except that one night where I was suffering from some traveller's diarrhea ü§¢, but that's another story, and one I won't both disclosing to you here). If you choose to visit Kenya‚Äîwhich I highly recommend‚Äîjust be sure you remember your small dollar bills to tip with... tipping in Kenya is expected!
## The Big 5

Africa considers five animals the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_five_game" target="_blank"&gt;Big 5&lt;/a&gt;. That means that if you can get on a safari that will show you all five, you just won the game lottery. They are elephants, lions, leopards, cape buffalo, and rhinoceroses. Finding elephants are easy; they're pretty much everywhere. Cape buffalo are also easy to spot, there's lots of them all over the place.

Lions are more difficult. Lionesses are okay to find... they do all of the hunting and caretaking, so they can mostly be found during the day sleeping under some trees or bushes, and then hunting at dawn and dusk. Male lions are harder because they're notorious for being lazy. Leopards are even more challenging to find. There's plenty of leopards in eastern Africa, but they're elusive. They're good at hiding; if they don't want to be found, they won't be. Sometimes, they hang out in trees sleeping during the day.

And lastly, you have your rhinoceroses. Southern white rhinos are decently easy enough to find‚Äî&lt;a href="https://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Ol Pejeta&lt;/a&gt;, a conservancy between Mount Kenya and Aberdares, has around 30, and there are approximately about 5,000 in Kenya alone. Although there aren't many sourthern white rhinos, they like to graze grass in open fields, making them easy to spot by safari truck. Black rhinos, on the other hand, are more rare. Ol Pejeta has  about 126, and they like to hide, which means that if you see a black rhino in Ol Pejeta, you just got lucky. Their snouts‚Äînot their color‚Äîare what distinguishes white rhinos versus black rhinos: white rhinos have flat snouts to graze grass, and black rhinos have pointier snouts to handle branches and bushes. In fact, the name "white rhino" is a mistranslation of the Afrikaans word "weit", meaning "wide"... they aren't supposed to be called "_white_ rhinos" at all!

## The Story of the Northern White Rhinoceros

Now, let's talk northern white rhinos. In 2009, four of the world's last northern white rhinos, two males and two females, were moved to Ol Pejeta. They were provided extensive security, nutritious diets, and plenty of space. But by 2014, when one of the males died of natural causes, there had been no reproduction between the rhinos.

Veterinarians came out to help, and after evaluating the rhinos, they found that the male rhino's sperm count was extremely low, given his age, and the females were unable to give conceive naturally, making it near impossible for them to further the species.

In 2015, both a zoo in the Czech Republic and the San Diego Zoo lost a northern white rhino, leaving the remaining three northerns the only northern white rhinos in the world.

In March of 2018, the last male northern white rhino passed away from old age and a series of infections. This loss is devastating for conservation efforts. The only good news is that Ol Pejeta, along with &lt;a href="https://safaripark.cz/" target="_blank"&gt;Dv√ºr Kr√°lov√© Zoo&lt;/a&gt;, have rescued some eggs and sperm from the rhinos, and believe that with the help of artificial insemination, it is possible to bring some baby northern white rhinos into the world.

The incredible news is, that as of August 22, 2019 (just days before I visited Ol Pejeta), seven northern white rhino eggs were successfully matured and artificially inseminated! You can read more about the press release &lt;a href="https://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/northern-white-rhino-eggs-fertilised/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This is an incredible step forward in the conservation efforts of the northern white rhino. The results of embryo development will be announced at the end of September.

## What Did We See?

Now that we've talked about some of the different animals visible in Kenya, the question is, where did _we_ go, and what did _we_ see?

### Aberdares County

We started our safaris at the Ark in the Aberdares mountain range. I'll talk more about the Ark in my next post, but the gist of it is that it's situated right on a watering hole. And so with the water (and the Ark _may_ place some yummy things in the dirt by the windows), animals will come to drink, graze, and relax right by the windows of the resort.

The Ark is where we saw our first cape buffalo, hyenas, warthogs (think Pumbaa!), and elephants.

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

At the Aberdares Country Club, near the Ark, we also saw some baboons, impalas, thomson's gazelles, and a peacock.

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
  &lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/184539266@N08/48740606758/in/album-72157710860887528/" target="_blank" title="peacock_at_aberdares_country_club"&gt;&lt;img class="my-image" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48740606758_0d4c94d668_z.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="Peacock at Aberdares Country Club"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/184539266@N08/48740935281/in/album-72157710860887528/" target="_blank" title="peacock_closeup"&gt;&lt;img class="my-image" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48740935281_7ddbc09737_z.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Peacock closeup"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Although there weren't many animals at the Ark, it was our first real chance to see some wildlife, and it was exciting, nevertheless.

### Samburu

Samburu is an area north of the equator, located in the center of Kenya. The land around here is dry and desert-like, with few bushes and trees. Here, we saw baboons, reticulated giraffes, oryxes, impalas, thomson's gazelles, elephants, dik diks, ostriches, grevy's zebras, grant's gazelles (what our safari truck called "diaper butts", and see why &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant%27s_gazelle" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and even a lioness resting in some bushes.

&lt;/div&gt;

The incredible thing is that, on these safaris, the animals will come right up to the safari truck, as long as the truck is quiet, still, and patient. There were moments where the elephants were passing right by the truck.

### Ol Pejeta

Ol Pejeta is located in central Kenya, just straight north of Nairobi. The game reserve and conservancy is the home of many different types of animals.

We managed to visit the Chimpanzee and Rhinoceros conservancies while we were there, and we managed to actually see chimpanzees interacting with each other (although they were lazily just lying around). We also had the unique opportunity to feed one of the black rhinos, a blind rhino named Baraka.

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
  &lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/184539266@N08/48741119427/in/album-72157710860887528/" target="_blank" title="chimp_at_ol_pejeta"&gt;&lt;img class="my-image" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48741119427_ecb6585700_z.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Chimpanzee at Ol Pejeta Conservancy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

We didn't see very many animals on the actual Ol Pejeta game drive, but we did see a dust tornado, and a storm settling in. It also rained while we were out driving, so we enjoyed the drop in temperature and playing &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTQbiNvZqaY" target="_blank"&gt;_Africa_ by Toto&lt;/a&gt; on our phones.

Sweetwaters, the tented camp where we stayed at Ol Pejeta, offered a special game drive at night. My partner and I decided to take Sweetwaters up on that, and we don't regret it at all. On that night game drive, we managed to see aardvarks (which are completely nocturnal, so we wouldn't have seen otherwise), a variety of antelopes, a black rhino running from our lights, several white rhinos, including their babies, hyenas, and elephants. Oh, and bunnies. So many bunnies. They'd run away from the safari trucks, but just keep running on the path in front of us... they were always so scared of us.

Long story short, doing a night game drive gave us the opportunity to see animals that we wouldn't have seen during the day. Unfortunately, because of the lighting, we weren't able to get any good pictures of the animals at night.

### Lake Naivasha

Lake Naivasha is a small lake just to the west of Nairobi. While there, we got the opportunity to go on a hippopotamus-viewing boat drive while on the lake We did see some hippos underwater, and we saw some of Kenya's eagles. But besides that, we didn't see too many new animals.

The resort where we stayed is famous for having hippos come graze on the grass right by the cabins, but we didn't see any hippos that night. We did manage to see some waterbucks grazing, but that was about it.

&lt;/div&gt;

### Maasai Mara

The Maasai Mara is where the Great Migration happens. Well, the Maasai Mara and the Serengeti. Actually, the Maasai Mara is the northern-most part of the Serengeti, but separated by the Tanzania/Kenya border. The two large areas have the same animals.

Because of the time of year we went, and the location, we managed to see thousands, perhaps even millions, of animals. We saw cheetahs feeding on a newly killed baby zebra üò≠, lion cubs playing, lionnesses hunting, a leopard sleeping in a tree, wildebeests, cape buffalo, plains zebras, hyenas, elephants, Maasai giraffes (only found in the Maasai Mara and the Serengeti), eland antelopes, kudu antelopes, oryxes, waterbucks, impalas, thomson's gazelles, gerenuks, hippos laying by the water in the sand, crocodiles, eagles, vultures, and bones... lots and lots of bones.

Although I wish I could attach all of the pictures we have from the Maasai Mara, I honestly can't... there's too many incredible ones. Intead, I'll have to add some of my favorites:

## Conclusion

All in all, we saw incredible animals at every location of our adventure. We met incredible people, learned amazing facts about the country and its animals, and we have great memories of each game drive we went on. As you can see from some of our photos, we saw unbelievable animals in their natural habitat, and that was worth every penny of this trip.

As I've begun working on this website, I've figured that I tend to use this punctuation a lot:
&gt; ‚Äî

But ‚Äî is not the same as -. Depending on the font and text editor, it can be hard to tell the difference. Let me show it to you this way:
&gt; ‚Äî

&gt; ‚Äì

&gt; -

Do you see it üëÄ? The top line is slightly longer than the middle, and the middle line is slightly longer than the bottom. Because they're all so similar, and I always want to make sure to use the correct punctuation in each circumstance, I thought it'd be a good idea to do some research into what they each mean, how to write them, and how to use them.

## The Hyphen

The hyphen is what we think of as a small dash. It should be used when combining two words together into a compound word, such as the following:
* well-being
* like-minded
* freeze-dried

The hyphen is also typically used as a minus sign in mathematics. Technically, the minus sign sits a bit higher than the hyphen (‚àí vs. -), but the only great way to make a minus sign is through emojis or special symbols, and that usually takes more time than it's worth.

### To Space or Not to Space

Generally, there should be no spaces surrounding a hyphen. The only exceptions would be in mathematics (where there should always be spaces around mathemtical operations), and when using a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Suspended_hyphens" target="_blank"&gt;hanging hyphen&lt;/a&gt;.

### How to Type a Hyphen

A hyphen key can be found on the top bar, usually between the `0`/`)` and `=`/`+` keys (on the typical Qwerty keyboard).

To type an official minus sign, as I alluded to before, you'll need to go through special symbols or through emojis. **Hint**: to quickly type an emoji in any text box/editor on a Mac, just type `CMD`+`CTRL`+`SPACE`.

## The Em

The em dash is what we normally consider as a dash. It's the longest form of a dash, and is to be used when placing a break in the middle of a sentence. They can be used as parentheses, like this:
&gt; This is an example sentence‚Äîjust in case you need one‚Äîthat shows off the use of an em dash.

Or they can be used one at a time to detach the ending of the sentence from the beginning.
&gt; Sally said that she was coming at 6‚Äîit is now 8 and she's still not here.

They can be useful when trying to write a longer sentence that contains a lot of commas, such as the following:
&gt; We got pencils, pens, notebooks, highlighters, and folders‚Äîall of which were on sale, of course‚Äîfor the kids to have for school.

### Em Dashes vs. Parentheses vs. Commas vs. Semicolons Vs. Ellipsis

When do we use em dashes (versus parenthesis, commas, semicolons, or ellipsis)? Generally, em dashes should only be used when a comma doesn't provide enough break in the sentence. If a comma works, then use that. Parentheses should be used when the enclosed part of the sentence is helpful, but not necessary. Em dashes draw attention to the enclosed words; parentheses draw attention away from them. Semicolons should be used to attach two sentences that go together, such as the sentence right before this one. An ellipsis is used to indicate a longer pause, or that something is missing. Examples:
* Comma:
&gt; Billy painted the walls blue, even though he doesn't like blue.
* Parentheses:
&gt; Even though Michael said he didn't like Trish romantically (I didn't believe him one bit), he still asked her to prom.
* Semicolon:
&gt; Chris suggested his mom would be in for the holidays; apparently I misunderstood.
* Ellipsis:
&gt; I'm going out to buy a ... what is that thing called again?
* Em dash:
&gt; We spent over $100‚Äîmost of which was on groceries‚Äîat Target the other day.

### To Space or Not to Space

There should be no spaces surrounding the em dash.

### How to Type an Em Dash

On a Mac, press `ALT`+`SHIFT`+`-` keys. Also, in some word processors, typing `-``-` will automatically turn into `‚Äî`. If you're using a Windows machine, you'll have to look elsewhere for resources on this‚ÄîI only use Macs.

On iPhones, press and hold the `-`, and a window will pop up that lets you select the `‚Äî`.

## The En

The en dash is slightly longer than a hyphen, but shorter than an em dash (the width of the en dash should be almost exactly the width of the letter "N", while the width of the em dash is the width of the letter "M"). The en dash means "through":
* 1992‚Äì2004
* Page 36‚Äì91
* May 6‚Äì17

### To Space or Not to Space

There should be no spaces surrounding the en dash.

### How to Type an En Dash

On a Mac, press `ALT`+`-` keys. If you're using a Windows machine, you'll have to look elsewhere for resources on this‚ÄîI only use Macs.

On iPhones, press and hold the `-`, and a window will pop up that lets you select the `‚Äì`.

As I stated in my original [_Switching to Jekyll_](/posts/2019-09-09-switching-to-jekyll) post, one of the original reasons I wanted to move to a Jekyll-based site was so that I could implement pagination on my "Blog" page(s). Converting my site to Jekyll was definitely challenging, and it involved me learning a new framework and a new language (Liquid). And therefore, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emma-sax4/emma-sax4.github.io/pull/6" target="_blank"&gt;pull request that made the switch&lt;/a&gt; was massive, and took a while‚Äîit had 54 changed files and 19 commits. Because of this, I decided that pagination should come in a separate pull request. And then, because I'm in my "website-phase", I thought I'd write a blog post about it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ.

I originally tried to add Jekyll's built-in pagination. Supposedly, it's pretty slick. You add a few sections to the `_config.yml`, a couple sections to your `index.html`, and bam: it's done and it works üí•. My real experience setting up the pagination was _not_ like that. In fact, within one commit, I learned that Jekyll's pagination (and other pagination gems), wouldn't work well with my current directory/file setup. Both &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/" target="_blank"&gt;Jekyll's built-in pagination&lt;/a&gt; and the gem &lt;a href="https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2" target="_blank"&gt;`jekyll-paginate-v2`&lt;/a&gt; expect the blog posts to be in a `_posts/` directory, and to be referenced by `site.posts`. They also expect the main "Blog" page to be in its own directory, and my stuff wasn't formatted like that. And so, instead of fighting with that, I decided to get more creative. That can't be the only pagination option, right? ü•¥üò¨üôèüèº

Turns out, the Google doesn't have a lot of other suggestions on pagination. But, the original Jekyll repository I copied (&lt;a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci/senior-seminar" target="_blank"&gt;UMM-CSci's `senior-seminar`&lt;/a&gt;), implements a version of pagination that's installed from &lt;a href="https://listjs.com/docs/pagination/" target="_blank"&gt;`List.js`&lt;/a&gt;. Possibly this is because that site uses `seminars` instead of `posts`. But either way, I decided to give it a chance. Worst case scenario, it just wouldn't work and I'd have to find another pagination option.

Of course, I started with the things I know how to do best: copy-paste üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I started with &lt;a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci/senior-seminar/blob/master/seminars.html#L63-L80" target="_blank"&gt;this blob&lt;/a&gt;, of course edited to suit my HTML file. Surprisingly, bits of this work right out of the box. But... the pagination isn't pretty, which is very important to me.

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
  &lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/184539266@N08/48741690227/in/album-72157710863695862/" target="_blank" title="bad_pagination_bar"&gt;&lt;img class="my-image" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48741690227_e27cb82884.jpg" width="450" height="367" alt="Bad pagination bar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

So, I went on a mission to figure out how to make a prettier pagination bar. After a couple of hours, and a good night's sleep, I realized that the answer lies in the `css/main.scss` file. Specifically, this line:
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>@import "core/index.scss";</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
Prior to adding that line, the whole Jekyll build would break. When I tried to load the project locally, my server would give me this error back:
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>".pagination .active .page" failed to
@extend ".selected". The selector ".selected"
was not found.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Clearly, that means my CSS is broken. But I didn't quite understand why üòï. The repository that I was copying pagination from included this line:

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
  &lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/184539266@N08/48741503991/in/album-72157710863695862/" target="_blank" title="primer_submodule_directory"&gt;&lt;img class="my-image" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48741503991_c9f4ec3ce4_o.png" width="486" height="45" alt="primer_submodule_directory"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Since I couldn't understand out why my CSS was broken, I figured it was time for me to try to add that "directory" to my repo.

I had never worked with submodules in Git before. So, I started how any developer-who-doesn't-recognize-anything would start: with Google. I started to google how to add submodules to Git repositories. And me, not liking to actually read anything, just started to jump in.

After everything, I ended up having to add, remove, re-add, re-remove, and re-re-add the `primer` submodule to my Git repo in order for it to commit in the repo, show up in the directory structure, and be sitting on the same commit as my example repository ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Here's a list of the resources I used to help me add the `primer` submodule:
* &lt;a href="https://chrisjean.com/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/" target="_blank"&gt;chrisjean.com: git submodules adding, using, removing, and updating&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10914022/how-do-i-check-out-a-specific-version-of-a-submodule-using-git-submodule" target="_blank"&gt;stackoverflow.com: how do I check out a specific version of a submodule using git submodule&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://twoguysarguing.wordpress.com/2010/11/14/tie-git-submodules-to-a-particular-commit-or-branch/" target="_blank"&gt;2guysarguing.wordpress.com: tie git submodules to a particular commit or branch&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://subfictional.com/fun-with-git-submodules/" target="_blank"&gt;subfictional.com: fun with git submodules&lt;/a&gt;
* And possibly others I can't find in my browser history anymore

Also, note that there is no easy way to remove a submodule. I'm just glad that I attempted this inside of a pull request because then I could `git reset` when things weren't going my way.

After I finished succesfully adding the `primer` submodule üòå, all I had to do was re-add
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>@import "core/index.scss";</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>back to my `main.scss`, and finally the pagination was beautiful:

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
  &lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/184539266@N08/48741504061/in/album-72157710863695862/" target="_blank" title="lovely_pagination_bar"&gt;&lt;img class="my-image" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48741504061_7ebbd630fa.jpg" width="450" height="311" alt="Lovely pagination bar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I was thrilled with the outcome of this pagination (even though it wasn't Jekyll's officially supported pagination), and I committed to master. However, perhaps a day later, I noticed something wrong with my CSS formatting. Perhaps you can notice it if you compare the before-pretty-pagination and the after-pretty-pagination pictures... I'll give you a hint: it has to do with the indentation and spacing of the words. Somehow, making the pagination bar pretty messed up my CSS formatting!

I was upset. I wanted to have both a pretty pagination bar and proper formatting of the text. So, I went back in my commit changes and commented out everything from when the site last worked as expected. I slowly uncommented line after line until I found the problem line.... of course it happened to be with the same line that makes the pagination work:
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>@import "core/index.scss";</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Are we even surprised üò§üôÑ?

So, I went on a mini-adventure through the `primer` code to see what that line was doing. Apparently, it ends up installing a bunch of CSS files through other nested CSS files. Let's be real, even if I have the time to go through each one looking for what may be conflicting with my `main.scss` file, I don't want to do that. So, I did an entire repository-wide file search for: `primer/pagination/index`, found the single pagination CSS page I needed (since that's all I'm using `primer` for), and switched to import just that:
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>@import "pagination/index.scss";</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
And it turns out, the answer was as easy as that! Now, I have proper CSS layouts, a lovely pagination bar that works and doesn't take long to load, and the file structure of my project was able to stay the same. The pagination bar isn't perfect, but it's better than anything I had before, and it's good enough for me‚Äîfor right now anyway.

Since the pagination part of this project is _finally_ done, I can officially say that I've now gotten everything out of Jekyll that I had hoped to, and then some. Not only did I implement a website with a "blog" that I'm proud of, but I learned a new framework and a new coding language. And most importantly, I reminded myself that one of the most important parts of being a coder is being willing to dive in, try something new, and not be afraid to fail.
A few days ago, I published another blog post (read it [here](/posts/2019-09-06-my-first-blog-post)), in which I stated that although I wanted to originally try to use Jekyll more, I gave up, instead favoring raw HTML files, hard-coding the headers and links.

After reflecting on this decision (after publishing that post of course), I changed my mind. I don't want to consider myself a giver-upper, and I certainly don't want to shy away from learning new coding frameworks, all because I don't want to spend a few more hours in front of the computer üíª. In fact, in the long run, utilizing Jekyll on this site will actually _save_ me time (and code) as I continue to add more posts and content to the site. However, if I'm completely honest, the biggest thing that made me want to switch to Jekyll was the ugly pagination that would have to be hard-coded and change frequently as more posts were added to the site. By switching to be Jekyll-based, this could be avoided.

So, the first thing I did, after making this decision, was to find an example repository that used Jekyll, so I could copy off of it. I ended up selecting &lt;a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci/senior-seminar" target="_blank"&gt;UMM-CSci's `senior-seminar`&lt;/a&gt;, which I had made a few other pull requests for during and right after college. I choose this because I had seen the code before, even if I never took the time to look at it in detail, and I knew (or once knew) the main contributors to the repository. I also vaguely remember the switch from raw HTML and Markdown files to Jekyll-based, which took place in &lt;a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci/senior-seminar/pull/9" target="_blank"&gt;this pull request&lt;/a&gt;, even if I didn't work on it myself. That pull request is hard to parse... it has 355 changed files, no comments, and only vague descriptions. For my switch, I didn't actually look at that PR, although I could've if I had wanted to üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

One of my flaws when I code is that I'm not always a big fan of thinking and reading.... I like to just jump in and start coding, especially if I'm working on my own project. So I skipped all of the official Jekyll documentation (I've looked at it since when googling, but I didn't start there), and I started copying files. I began with the `_includes/` directory, AKA the first directory GitHub shows in the root directory. And I kept copying the basic files, making small changes to my copies, as necessary.

Before long, I had a working homepage, with a single item in the header ("Home"), and my pictures showed up. As I started adding more pages, I got more understanding of the purpose of each directory, and how the Markdown files and HTML files worked together. By the time I moved onto the most complicated page, the "Blog" page, I had a decent understanding of the basics of Jekyll.

But it wasn't until I started working on the "Blog" page that I got to play around with collections, loops, `if`s, etc. My first goal was to make the list of posts all show up as they were supposed to, with the proper title(s) and dates. It turns out Jekyll makes this pretty easy. This sweet line gathers all of the blog posts on the site:
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>{{ site.posts }}</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
And you can loop through them like this:
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>{% for post in site.posts %}
  {{ post.title }}
{% endfor %}</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
Then I wanted to add appropriate buttons to go back to the whole list of posts, and to the more general collections of posts, if there were any posts that were intentionally grouped together. This would also be the start of adding tags to the posts in order to organize them together, beyond just the titles. With this, I had to categorize each post, figure out how to compare the tags, and filter the posts based on the tags assigned. The easiest answer I found was to add a single `tag` to each main posts list, which would eventually be the tag to show on that page. Then, have each post have a list of `tags`. And any post that includes that single `tag` would appear on that list üí°. It only took me about 3Ô∏è‚É£ hours to come up with that.

The latest addition to the posts collection was to utilize <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts"</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">"_blank"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Jekyll's draft<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> capability. I wanted an easy way to make draft posts, where I could work on them, and leave them until I was ready to publish them. I'm fully aware that even drafts aren't fully private; drafts are stored as Markdown files on GitHub in a public repository, so anyone could see an unpublished draft by just viewing it on GitHub. But, using the built-in draft capability would make it easier for people that only view the website, not in GitHub.

And then also, there's a `show_drafts: false` line to add to the `_config.yml`, which all of the official documentation fails to mention. They talk about running the local server with the `--drafts` flag, but don't talk about changing the config file. So, it took me quite a bit of googling until I could fit together all of those puzzle pieces üß©.

Hours of work later‚ÄîI'm writing this Sunday night, and I started switching to Jekyll on Friday‚ÄîI finally have a Jekyll-based site that's hosted fully on GitHub pages. I stayed up until 2am Friday night, and 5am Saturday night, prepping this. The main before-and-after content pages look _super_ similar, which is the point. The biggest difference is the "Blog" page, which is now set up for success in the future, even if it isn't too different right now.

I still have work to do with Jekyll. I haven't finished setting up my paginated "Blog" pages yet. After that's done, I'll start working on filtering the posts by tags, which also Jekyll supports. But the main point is that, the only way I could fully learn Jekyll, and feel more confident with it, is by jumping in, and using it. And, by using Jekyll to help you compile your site, you can avoid typing long blog posts and content pages with HTML... it's so much easier to get in the writing zone in Markdown üôåüèº!

      <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>I like to consider myself a world traveler. I‚Äôm not going to pretend I don‚Äôt like home; coming home after a long, and sometimes uncomfortable trip, can be super relaxing. Sleeping in my own bed, taking a warm shower, changing my clothes, eating familiar foods, etc, is sometimes <span class="nt">&lt;em&gt;</span>exactly<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;</span> what I need. But, I also love to go to different places around the world.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>I love seeing the locals, what they wear and how they act. I like trying some of their foods (although I‚Äôm vegetarian, so all food tastes are within that constraint), and I like seeing how they live. Depending on where I‚Äôm going, I‚Äôm also going to be interested in other things.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>If I‚Äôm going to someplace in Europe, then I‚Äôm going to want to visit museums, castles, and famous neighborhoods. If I‚Äôm visiting Hollywood, I‚Äôll want to go to the Griffith Observatory to see the Hollywood sign and to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame. For my most recent vacation, I went to Kenya. And when I go to this type of African country, you can bet I‚Äôm there to see animals.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>But I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. Let‚Äôs start with the plane ride. We rode with Kenya Airways on the 14.5 hour plane üõ© ride from JFK to Nairobi. The first thing we noticed when we got on the flight was it was hot. Like the temperature üå°‚Ä¶ we were sweating. We were in Row 12. After talking with some of the other people in our tour group, we learned that the issue was probably because the flight attendants closed the curtain between Main Cabin and First Class, but either way, it was still uncomfortably hot in our seats. We made a mental note that for our return flight, no more sitting at the front of Main Cabin (we sat in Row 17 on the way back, and it was much better).<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Despite the heat, we persevered, and 9 hours later, and a few naps, movies, and meals later, we were passing over the Sahara Desert. Then another few hours later, our plane was finally nearing Nairobi. If there‚Äôs anything to remind us that Africa is <span class="nt">&lt;strong&gt;</span>huge<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>, it‚Äôs the amount of time it took us to cross the continent.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"text-center"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">data-flickr-embed=</span><span class="s">"true"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://www.flickr.com/photos/184539266@N08/48740606523/in/album-72157710860887528/"</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">"_blank"</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">"fly_over_nairobi"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;img</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"my-image"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48740606523_77e7b836e4_o.jpg"</span> <span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">"500"</span> <span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">"375"</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">"Our plane flying towards Nairobi"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>After landing, getting through Customs, and picking up our bags, the first thing I noticed was the amount of guns the guards at the airport had. I‚Äôm not really a big gun person, so I‚Äôm not sure what types of guns they were, but I think maybe they were AK-47s or something‚Ä¶ they looked to be military style üôÄ. And they were all over. A few of us theorized that they were actually empty, and that people were only carrying them around for show‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt feel like seeing if they were right or not. Either way, by the end of the trip, I eventually got used to the security guards always carrying weapons (huge rifles, large sticks, sharp knives, etc).<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>After a stop at Safaricom to get an international SIM card (~$10 for one month of data!) and a stop at an ATM to pick up some cash, we checked into our first hotel. We were surprised to find the hotel had metal detectors at the entrance. Shortly after, we were told by our tour guides that we were advised not to leave the hotel for safely reasons üò¨. Welcome to Kenya, everybody!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"page-body"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>I‚Äôve been wanting to start a blog for myself for a while, but I‚Äôve been having trouble figuring out where to start. But, there‚Äôs no time like the present, so I thought I might as well just go for it!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>The very first blog I started, used Ruby On Rails‚Ä¶. you can check it out <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://github.com/emma-sax4/blog"</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">"_blank"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>here<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>. Needless to say, it didn‚Äôt go very well.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>But since I started to beef up this little website (which, ü§´, is actually just a bunch of static HTML files), I decided that I could probably just add the blog functionality to this site.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>I originally wanted to try to use layouts, Jekyll, and javascript-like styles to store the blogs as Markdown files. In that case, the main "Blog" page would just use a fancy little loop to show each of the blog posts. But that turned out to be more difficult than I thought it would be. In all honesty, I could figure it all out myself‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs plenty of examples out there in GitHub. But I had a limited amount of time I wanted to spend putting the blog together, and tbh, I had a limited amount of patience as well.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Instead, I figured‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm afraid of neither a little bit of HTML nor a little bit of duplicated code (I know the code isn‚Äôt as "pretty", and if there was actual functionality on this website, I would try harder to avoid it). So, I realized that I could make a decently good blog function by simply being smart about my HTML, CSS, and <span class="nt">&lt;code</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"highlighter-rouge"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>href<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> linking. At the very least, it would look professional, and like I knew what I was doing, even if the skeleton of the code is a little ugly.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Then, I went a step further. I added a <span class="nt">&lt;code</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"highlighter-rouge"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>.htaccess<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> file (even though GitHub Pages normally doesn‚Äôt play nice with that file), so that the URLs of this website could hide the <span class="nt">&lt;code</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"highlighter-rouge"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>.html<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> endings of the HTML pages. In this way, the website wouldn‚Äôt show up as obviously just a compilation of HTML files‚Ä¶. aka it makes it look like the whole website is served using RoR or something like that. And then, using a little bit of directory-magic, I can add a bunch of posts in a <span class="nt">&lt;code</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"highlighter-rouge"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>_posts/<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> directory ‚Äî and link to them appropriately. Add in a <span class="nt">&lt;code</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"highlighter-rouge"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Back<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> button, and voil√†‚Ä¶ here we are!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Now I have a blog feature that I can edit as I choose (as long as I‚Äôm willing to duplicate my code). I‚Äôm excited to add my next blog post to the list. Let‚Äôs see how long it takes for this blog to stop being updated‚Ä¶. it may just be a phase.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>** It‚Äôs come to my attention that there are a few aspects of a <span class="nt">&lt;em&gt;</span>blog<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;</span> that this doesn‚Äôt include. Mainly, the ability to comment, converse with others, and have notes regarding each blog post.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

  My First Blog Post

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I wanted to add appropriate buttons to go back to the whole list of posts, and to the more general collections of posts, if there were any posts that were intentionally grouped together. This would also be the start of adding tags to the posts in order to organize them together, beyond just the titles. With this, I had to categorize each post, figure out how to compare the tags, and filter the posts based on the tags assigned. The easiest answer I found was to add a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">tag</code> to each main posts list, which would eventually be the tag to show on that page. Then, have each post have a list of <code class="highlighter-rouge">tags</code>. And any post that includes that single <code class="highlighter-rouge">tag</code> would appear on that list üí°. It only took me about 3Ô∏è‚É£ hours to come up with that.</p>

<p>The latest addition to the posts collection was to utilize <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts" target="_blank">Jekyll‚Äôs draft</a> capability. I wanted an easy way to make draft posts, where I could work on them, and leave them until I was ready to publish them. I‚Äôm fully aware that even drafts aren‚Äôt fully private; drafts are stored as Markdown files on GitHub in a public repository, so anyone could see an unpublished draft by just viewing it on GitHub. But, using the built-in draft capability would make it easier for people that only view the website, not in GitHub.</p>

<p>And then also, there‚Äôs a <code class="highlighter-rouge">show_drafts: false</code> line to add to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>, which all of the official documentation fails to mention. They talk about running the local server with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--drafts</code> flag, but don‚Äôt talk about changing the config file. So, it took me quite a bit of googling until I could fit together all of those puzzle pieces üß©.</p>

<p>Hours of work later‚ÄîI‚Äôm writing this Sunday night, and I started switching to Jekyll on Friday‚ÄîI finally have a Jekyll-based site that‚Äôs hosted fully on GitHub pages. I stayed up until 2am Friday night, and 5am Saturday night, prepping this. The main before-and-after content pages look <em>super</em> similar, which is the point. The biggest difference is the "Blog" page, which is now set up for success in the future, even if it isn‚Äôt too different right now.</p>

<p>I still have work to do with Jekyll. I haven‚Äôt finished setting up my paginated "Blog" pages yet. After that‚Äôs done, I‚Äôll start working on filtering the posts by tags, which also Jekyll supports. But the main point is that, the only way I could fully learn Jekyll, and feel more confident with it, is by jumping in, and using it. And, by using Jekyll to help you compile your site, you can avoid typing long blog posts and content pages with HTML‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so much easier to get in the writing zone in Markdown üôåüèº!</p>

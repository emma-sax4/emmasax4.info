  <h1>Switching to Jekyll</h1>


    <div class="page-body">
      <p>A few days ago, I published another thought (read it <a href="/posts/2019-09-06-my-first-thought">here</a>), in which I stated that although I wanted to originally try to use Jekyll more, I gave up, instead favoring raw HTML files, hard-coding the headers and links.</p>

<p>After reflecting on this decision (after publishing that thought of course), I changed my mind. I don‚Äôt want to consider myself a giver-upper, and I certainly don‚Äôt want to shy away from learning new coding frameworks, all because I don‚Äôt want to spend a few more hours in front of the computer üíª. In fact, in the long run, utilizing Jekyll on this site will actually <em>save</em> me time (and code) as I continue to add more thoughts and content to the site. However, if I‚Äôm completely honest, the biggest thing that made me want to switch to Jekyll was the ugly pagination that would have to be hard-coded and change frequently as more thoughts were added to the site. By switching to be Jekyll-based, this could be avoided.</p>

<p>So, the first thing I did, after making this decision, was to find an example repository that used Jekyll, so I could copy off of it. I ended up selecting <a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci/senior-seminar" target="_blank">UMM-CSci‚Äôs <code class="highlighter-rouge">senior-seminar</code></a>, which I had made a few other pull requests for during and right after college. I choose this because I had seen the code before, even if I never took the time to look at it in detail, and I knew (or once knew) the main contributors to the repository. I also vaguely remember the switch from raw HTML and Markdown files to Jekyll-based, which took place in <a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci/senior-seminar/pull/9" target="_blank">this pull request</a>, even if I didn‚Äôt work on it myself. That pull request is hard to parse‚Ä¶ it has 355 changed files, no comments, and only vague descriptions. For my switch, I didn‚Äôt actually look at that PR, although I could‚Äôve if I had wanted to üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.</p>

<p>One of my flaws when I code is that I‚Äôm not always a big fan of thinking and reading‚Ä¶. I like to just jump in and start coding, especially if I‚Äôm working on my own project. So I skipped all of the official Jekyll documentation (I‚Äôve looked at it since when googling, but I didn‚Äôt start there), and I started copying files. I began with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes/</code> directory, AKA the first directory GitHub shows in the root directory. And I kept copying the basic files, making small changes to my copies, as necessary.</p>

<p>Before long, I had a working homepage, with a single item in the header ("Home"), and my pictures showed up. As I started adding more pages, I got more understanding of the purpose of each directory, and how the Markdown files and HTML files worked together. By the time I moved onto the most complicated page, the "Thoughts" page, I had a decent understanding of the basics of Jekyll.</p>

<p>But it wasn‚Äôt until I started working on "Thoughts" that I got to play around with collections, loops, <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code>s, etc. My first goal was to make the list of thoughts all show up as they were supposed to, with the proper title(s) and dates. Jekyll, by default, calls the main collection "posts", so that was the first adventure‚Ä¶ finding out how to call them "thoughts" instead.</p>

<p>Then I wanted to add appropriate buttons to go back to the whole list of thoughts, and to the more general sets of thoughts, if there were any thoughts that were intentionally grouped together. This would also be the start of adding tags to the thoughts in order to organize them together, beyond just the titles. With this, I had to categorize each thought, figure out how to compare the tags, and filter the thoughts based on the tags assigned. The easiest answer I found was to add a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">tag</code> to each main thoughts list, which would eventually be the tag to show on that page. Then, have each thought have a list of <code class="highlighter-rouge">tags</code>. And any thought that includes that single <code class="highlighter-rouge">tag</code> would appear on that list üí°. It only took me about 3Ô∏è‚É£ hours to come up with that.</p>

<p>The latest addition to the thoughts collection was to utilize <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts" target="_blank">Jekyll‚Äôs draft</a> capability. I wanted an easy way to make draft thoughts, where I could work on them, and leave them until I was ready to publish them. I‚Äôm fully aware that even drafts aren‚Äôt fully private; drafts are stored as Markdown files on GitHub in a public repository, so anyone could see an unpublished draft by just viewing it on GitHub. But, using the built-in draft capability would make it easier for people that only view the website, not in GitHub.</p>

<p>The only big hiccup I found while implementing the drafts is that Jekyll considers drafts as posts, so you have to reference them as <code class="highlighter-rouge">site.posts</code>, versus <code class="highlighter-rouge">site.thoughts</code>, which is my hand-crafted version of "posts". And then, because they‚Äôre considered two different lists, you have to concat the two arrays:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{Ôπ™ assign drafts = site.posts Ôπ™}
{Ôπ™ assign published = site.thoughts Ôπ™}
{Ôπ™ assign all_thoughts = drafts | concat: published Ôπ™}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then also, there‚Äôs a <code class="highlighter-rouge">show_drafts: false</code> line to add to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>, which all of the official documentation fails to mention. They talk about running the local server with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--drafts</code> flag, but don‚Äôt talk about changing the config file. So, it took me quite a bit of googling until I could fit together all of those puzzle pieces üß©.</p>

<p>Hours of work later‚ÄîI‚Äôm writing this Sunday night, and I started switching to Jekyll on Friday‚ÄîI finally have a Jekyll-based site that‚Äôs hosted fully on GitHub pages. I stayed up until 2am Friday night, and 5am Saturday night, prepping this. The main before-and-after content pages look <em>super</em> similar, which is the point. The biggest difference is the thoughts page, which is now set up for success in the future, even if it isn‚Äôt too different right now.</p>

<p>I still have work to do with Jekyll. I haven‚Äôt finished setting up my paginated thoughts pages yet. After that‚Äôs done, I‚Äôll start working on filtering the thoughts by tags, which also Jekyll supports. But the main point is that, the only way I could fully learn Jekyll, and feel more confident with it, is by jumping in, and using it. And, by using Jekyll to help you compile your site, you can avoid typing long blog posts and content pages with HTML‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so much easier to get in the writing zone in Markdown üôåüèº!</p>

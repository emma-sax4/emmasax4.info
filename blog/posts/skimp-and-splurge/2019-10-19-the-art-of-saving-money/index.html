<hr />

<p>There comes a point in most young adultsâ€™ lives where they need to think about saving money. Whether they just graduated from college, just bought their first car, or are trying to save for a special occasion, itâ€™s important to understand that money doesnâ€™t grow on trees. Thereâ€™s rarely a way for an average, middle-class 20-something-year-old to afford everything theyâ€™d like to have and have a reasonable savings account, too. Therefore, itâ€™s up to the person to decide how theyâ€™d like to spend their money. Which usually involves a mixture of, what I call, "skimping" on things and "splurging" on things.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s 10 things my list of "skimps" and "splurges":</p>

<h3 id="1-skimp-daily-coffee">1. SKIMP: daily coffee</h3>

<p>In fact, I donâ€™t drink any coffee at all. Call me lucky that I donâ€™t need the pick-me-up of energy in the morning, but because of it, I can easily save $150 a month from frequent trips to Starbucks.</p>

<h3 id="2-splurge-apartment-rent">2. SPLURGE: apartment rent</h3>

<p>Even though apartments provide a low-contract living situation, I like knowing that the place Iâ€™m living in is decently nice, in a good neighborhood, and I would feel comfortable living there for years to come if I wanted to. And itâ€™s not like I was super picky. In fact, my requirement for living there included 6 things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Central heat</li>
  <li>Air conditioning</li>
  <li>Dishwasher</li>
  <li>Underground parking available</li>
  <li>Free laundry (does not necessarily mean in-unit washer/dryer)</li>
  <li>Fitness room in building</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-skimp-tons-of-new-clothes">3. SKIMP: tons of new clothes</h3>

<p>Call it luck that at my job, jeans and t-shirts are totally appropriate, but I never am willing to spend more than about $30 on a shirt or a pair of pants if I donâ€™t have to. Stay away from the designer stores and expensive retail stores. I only buy expensive clothes when I know Iâ€™ll be wearing them to a very important occasion.</p>

<h3 id="4-splurge-eating-at-nice-restaurants">4. SPLURGE: eating at nice restaurants</h3>

<p>I donâ€™t mean super pricey restaurants, just ones that arenâ€™t fast-food chains. I would never skip on going out to eat with an old friend at a decently nice restaurant. Worst case scenario, Iâ€™m fed with good-tasting food, my wallet is $45 lighter, and Iâ€™ve gotten some socializing done with friend(s). Could be worse. And Iâ€™ll probably get leftovers out of it, too.</p>

<h3 id="5-skimp-tons-of-takeout-and-fast-food">5. SKIMP: tons of takeout and fast-food</h3>

<p>Although it doesnâ€™t seem like much, a monthâ€™s worth of take out fees and fast-food adds up. Iâ€™d much rather cook one meal, and have it and its leftovers last me three days than spend $5-10 every two days on lunches.</p>

<h3 id="6-splurge-netflix">6. SPLURGE: Netflix</h3>

<p>Of course everyone will have different opinions about this, but for me, Netflix is a necessity. Almost right up there with internet. For me, Netflix can easily occupy 3 hours worth of time, and it is a good distraction from the rest of your life when you just need a break.</p>

<h3 id="7-skimp-expensive-phone-bills-with-tons-of-unused-data">7. SKIMP: expensive phone bills with tons of unused data</h3>

<p>If you plan on getting Internet and WiFi at your apartment, like most people have, then you can skip on the data a little bit. For me, 5GB is plenty for the occasional watching of videos and browsing the web. But to each their own (some people use over 10GB a month, and I know that).</p>

<h3 id="8-splurge-a-good-car">8. SPLURGE: a good car</h3>

<p>Yes, my car was not cheap. I got a brand new Honda CR-V, with only 11 miles on it. The reason I got this car was because I think of it like an investment. If I bought a cheap car with 120,000 miles on it and it needed maintenance and new parts, then I spend the original amount on the car, plus gas, insurance, the maintenance, and parts. And, it could only last me 2-3 more years. But, if I buy a nice car that isnâ€™t old and doesnâ€™t need a lot of work, assuming I take proper care of the car, it could potentially last me 7 more years. And, I love my car.</p>

<h3 id="9-skimp-buying-a-couch-right-when-i-move-out">9. SKIMP: buying a couch right when I move out</h3>

<p>The truth is, when you first move out, there are some things you need. Some pots and pans, and a shower curtain fall under that list. There are also some things you donâ€™t need right away. A couch and a TV are in that list. Couches are expensive. Besides the bed/mattress and the dining table/chairs, itâ€™ll be in the top 5 most expensive things youâ€™ll buy for quite a while (at least in terms of furniture). Therefore, skip the couch. If youâ€™re a college student, youâ€™re probably used to lying on your bed watching cute animal videos anyway, so youâ€™ll do just fine without a couch if you wait a couple months.</p>

<h3 id="10-splurge-a-good-bed">10. SPLURGE: a good bed</h3>

<p>The thing with mattresses is, the better quality mattress you buy, the longer itâ€™ll last, the more comfortable itâ€™ll be, and the better youâ€™ll sleep. And hopefully youâ€™ll learn sometime in your adult life that sleeping is never something you should skimp on if you can help it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, I hope this list might help you as you begin to budget, make real money  for yourself, and figure out how you want to live your financial life. Thanks for reading!</p>

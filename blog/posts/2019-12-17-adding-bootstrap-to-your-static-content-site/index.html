    <div class="page-body">
      <p>Between when I originally turned this website into a Jekyll site and a couple of weeks ago, a decent amount of CSS in the site had been slowly changing. First of all, the navigation bar had gone from a whole quarter of the screen to just a small top bar. The navigation words had moved to the right of the screen. But most importantly, I was attempting to make the site responsive to different screen widths (particularly mobile vs. computer). And there was a point when I realized that there were certain limitations my CSS/HTML knowledge had.</p>

<p>Although it is arguably beneficial for a coder like me (that‚Äôs young in my career) to hand-craft all of my site‚Äôs CSS, the truth is that the site won‚Äôt come out as nicely as if I use a 3rd party tool. And, one could even claim that getting experience in implementing a 3rd party tool, and figuring out the best ways to use it, is even better experience.</p>

<p>So, let‚Äôs walk through the process of adding Bootstrap to a Jekyll site, since this is what I did <em>very</em> recently.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="install-bootstrap-into-your-site">Install Bootstrap into your site</h2>

<p>I selected to use the most recent version of Bootstrap (4.4), and wanted to install it via a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> and CDN. If you put this line right before where your site links your own stylesheets, then it‚Äôll automatically import this and combine the two CSS‚Äôs:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your site will take all of Bootstrap‚Äôs CSS, and then consider whatever you‚Äôve coded as overrides.</p>

<h2 id="load-your-site-locally-and-see-what-breaks-Ô∏è">Load your site locally and see what breaks ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>

<p>When I first loaded my site, a surprising amount of the site successfully showed up. In fact, I‚Äôd even say that it pretty much looked exactly like what it was before, because my local CSS was overriding all of Bootstrap‚Äôs CSS. The only big thing that changed was my font styles. At the end of the day, I chose to keep Bootstrap‚Äôs styles anyway because I started to get used to the new font.</p>

<p>If your site does start to break, then that‚Äôs an indicator that there‚Äôs probably some of your custom CSS that you should get rid of. If you‚Äôre going to use Bootstrap, you might as well <em>use</em> Bootstrap, which includes using most of Bootstrap‚Äôs functionality and features.</p>

<h2 id="go-through-your-css-bit-by-bit-and-delete-those-bits">Go through your CSS bit by bit and delete those bits</h2>

<p>To do this part, I started with the biggest single element I could find: my navbar. I started by taking a look at <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/" target="_blank">Bootstrap‚Äôs built-in navbar</a>, and worked my way through my particular HTML file implementing a basic version of Bootstrap‚Äôs navbar. This involved changing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">class</code> names and moving around the lines of Jekyll code that write the menu on the top. I didn‚Äôt care if it was responsive or not; I could get to that later.</p>

<p>After I implemented the basics of the navbar, it worked pretty miraculously. It also turned out to basically be responsive right away, all I had to do was modify a few more <code class="highlighter-rouge">class</code> names. Then, it was time to make the navbar look like mine (with similar colors, sizing, etc).</p>

<p>I did an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Inspect element</code> on Bootstrap‚Äôs website to see what I should name the CSS class in my own repo: <code class="highlighter-rouge">nav.navbar</code>. Then, I simply copied over my color scheme:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nav.navbar {
  background-color: rgb(27, 14, 172);
  background: linear-gradient(to right, rgb(27, 14, 172), rgb(107, 208, 245));
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, right away I could delete all of the old navbar CSS code! This included a solid chunk of lines!</p>

<p>Next, I wanted to make it so the menu button (also known as a hamburger üçî icon) would turn into an ‚ùå button when the navbar expanded. This took more time, and to be honest, if not for <a href="https://github.com/brianMitchL" target="_blank">@brianMitchL</a>‚Äôs help, I may still be struggling. In order to save you from struggling, I‚Äôll give you some code:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nav.navbar {
  &gt; .navbar-toggler {
    // The toggle button
  }

  .navbar-toggler[aria-expanded="false"] &gt; .x {
    // ‚ùå icon
    display: none;
  }

  .navbar-toggler[aria-expanded="true"] &gt; .menu {
    // üçî icon
    display: none;
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, with only 20 minutes of work, I have a fully-functioning navbar that fits Accessibility standards, too!</p>

<p>After the navbar, I tackled <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/" target="_blank">Boostrap‚Äôs buttons</a>, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/" target="_blank">general page layouts</a>, and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/" target="_blank">columns</a>.</p>

<p>To do the buttons, you can go through the same process as with the navbar:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Look up the basic Bootstrap button‚Äôs HTML</li>
  <li>Make your button(s) have the same <code class="highlighter-rouge">class</code> names</li>
  <li>Once the button looks like Bootstrap‚Äôs then make small tweaks to Bootstrap‚Äôs CSS class(es) to make it format like how you want it</li>
  <li>Delete your button CSS</li>
</ol>

<p>Same process with the columns. To do the page layouts and responsive breakpoints, the only piece of knowledge that I didn‚Äôt know (until Brian came along), was that Bootstrap‚Äôs automatically going to expect:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;main class="container"&gt;

  &lt;/main&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Previously, I was running that second line without the <code class="highlighter-rouge">class="container"</code>. But, once we added that, suddenly the entire site‚Äôs body was fully responsive! Now, everything word-wrapped appropriately from a huge screen, right down to 320px wide (the size of an iPhone 5/SE). It‚Äôs brilliant!</p>

<p>Over the next couple days, I eventually completely switched to using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/" target="_blank">Bootstrap‚Äôs tables</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/pagination/" target="_blank">Bootstrap‚Äôs pagination</a> (but I‚Äôll get to that in another blog post).</p>

<p>At the end of the day (or a few days), my repo ended up going from over 650 lines of CSS code to 185 lines. That means I cut out at least 72% of my existing CSS code. <em>And</em> I have a better-looking, more responsive, more modern, and accessible website? It‚Äôs a win-win.</p>

<hr />

<p>Thank you so much for getting to the bottom of that rather technical blog post. I hope it‚Äôs enough compelling evidence to remember that using a 3rd party tool to make your website‚Äôs CSS better is worth it. If I (a back-end coder with very little CSS experience) can make it happen, then so can you üòâ.</p>

  <h1>My First Thought</h1>


    <div class="page-body">
      <p>Iâ€™ve been wanting to start a blog for myself for a while, but Iâ€™ve been having trouble figuring out where to start. But, thereâ€™s no time like the present, so I thought I might as well just go for it!</p>

<p>The very first blog I started, used Ruby On Railsâ€¦. you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/emma-sax4/blog" target="_blank">here</a>. Needless to say, it didnâ€™t go very well.</p>

<p>But since I started to beef up this little website (which, ðŸ¤«, is actually just a bunch of static HTML files), I decided that I could probably just add the blog functionality to this site.</p>

<p>I originally wanted to try to use layouts, Jekyll, and javascript-like styles to store the blogs as Markdown files. In that case, the main "Thoughts" page would just use a fancy little loop to show each of the blog lines (which I named "thoughts"). But that turned out to be more difficult than I thought it would be. In all honesty, I could figure it all out myselfâ€¦ thereâ€™s plenty of examples out there in GitHub. But I had a limited amount of time I wanted to spend putting the blog together, and tbh, I had a limited amount of patience as well.</p>

<p>Instead, I figuredâ€¦ Iâ€™m afraid of neither a little bit of HTML nor a little bit of duplicated code (I know the code isnâ€™t as "pretty", and if there was actual functionality on this website, I would try harder to avoid it). So, I realized that I could make a decently good blog function by simply being smart about my HTML, CSS, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">href</code> linking. At the very least, it would look professional, and like I knew what I was doing, even if the skeleton of the code is a little ugly.</p>

<p>Then, I went a step further. I added a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.htaccess</code> file (even though GitHub Pages normally doesnâ€™t play nice with that file), so that the URLs of this website could hide the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.html</code> endings of the HTML pages. In this way, the website wouldnâ€™t show up as obviously just a compilation of HTML filesâ€¦. aka it makes it look like the whole website is served using RoR or something like that. And then, using a little bit of directory-magic, I can add a bunch of thoughts in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">thought/</code> directory â€” and link to them appropriately. Add in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Back</code> button, and voilÃ â€¦ here we are!</p>

<p>Now I have a blog feature that I can edit as I choose (as long as Iâ€™m willing to duplicate my code). Iâ€™m excited to add my next "thought" to the list. Letâ€™s see how long it takes for this blog to stop being updatedâ€¦. it may just be a phase.</p>

<p>** Itâ€™s come to my attention that there are a few aspects of a <em>blog</em> that this doesnâ€™t include. Mainly, the ability to comment, converse with others, and have notes regarding each blog post. I guess thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m calling these <em>thoughts</em> instead of <em>blog posts</em>.</p>

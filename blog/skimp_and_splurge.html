<p>
  This is a set of posts that are all inspired from an original "blog" post that I wrote in December of 2016, titled <em>Skimp and Splurge: The Art of Saving Money</em>. I decided to turn this singular blog post into a Set when I decided to do a re-evaluation of the items in that post. Going forward, I also hope to conduct interviews with people in my life to get their opinions on these items as well, to create into an even larger Set.

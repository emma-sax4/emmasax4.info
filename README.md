This is Emma Sax's website, which contains brief information about who I am and what I do, as well as links to a few other sites (such as GitHub and LinkedIn) about me, as well as link to download a copy of my resume. It includes some pictures and descriptions of what I've done recently. My contact info is included.

The original GitHub pages theme that I used was the [Cayman theme](https://github.com/jasonlong/cayman-theme) by [Jason Long](https://twitter.com/jasonlong).

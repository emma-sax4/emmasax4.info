# Add _blog_posts because we want Jekyll to read each file as its own page. It starts with _
# because it's also a collection that needs to be read below. We don't need to include _lego because
# Jekyll doesn't need to convert each file inside to its own page; we call `{{ element.content }}`
# on each LEGO element instead. If we viewed a page of each element individually, we'd need to
# add _lego to this list and add a permalink to each one.

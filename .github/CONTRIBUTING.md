## Contribution Process

1. Fork this repository: https://github.com/emma-sax4/emma-sax4.github.io/fork.
2. Triple check you're currently on the `release` branch.
3. Make your changes on a feature branch:

  | With GitHub UI | On your computer with Git |
  |----------------|---------------------------|
  | Make your first change. | Make sure you have this repository cloned to your machine and then create your feature branch. <br>`git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch` |
  | When you're ready to commit your first change, make a new branch and name it appropriately. | Make your first few changes. |
  | Click that green `Commit changes` button. | Commit and push your changes.<br>`git commit -am "Add some feature" && git push` |
  | Make a new pull request for your new branch (GitHub UI should automatically direct you to do this). | Continue making changes and committing/pushing them (unless you leave your feature branch, all new commits will be automatically added to your branch). |
  | Continue making changes to your pull request/branch (navigate to the main repository page, switch to your feature branch, and then continue making whatever changes you'd like). | When you're satisfied, make a pull request to this repository in the GitHub UI. |

4. Verify Travis CI passes on your pull request. The test configuration lives inside the [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/emma-sax4/emma-sax4.github.io/blob/release/.travis.yml) file. Read more about this repository's tests below.
5. Check the site looks like how you expect it to look. Follow the instructions below to get your computer running the site locally. If you've been working on GitHub UI up until this point, you may need to switch over to a computer and clone the repository and branch to do this.
6. When you're absolutely ready for me to look at your pull request, please request a Code Review from me in the pull request. If I don't comment or start looking at the pull request in a few days, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:emma.sax4@gmail.com).

Happy coding! ðŸ¤—

## Running Locally

To run this application locally, following these steps:
1. Be sure you have Ruby installed on your machine; the `.ruby-version` file specifies ruby 2.6.5 because that's the latest stable version of Ruby.
2. First, bundle install and install all of the gems specified in the Gemfile:
    ```bash
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    ```
3. Then build and serve the site using Jekyll:
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve # with optional --future flag
    ```
4. Navigate to the local URL Jekyll provides (`http://127.0.0.1:4000` on my machine).

To view Disqus comments and comment loading locally, run Jekyll in the `production` environment (local development, where the environment is automatically `development`, does not show comments):
```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll serve # with optional --future flag
```

NOTE: Running this process locally will most likely create at least one directory locally on your machine, such as `_site/` and `.sass-cache/`, and potentially others. All of these are already in the `.gitignore`, but feel free to add others as necessary.

## Tests with Travis CI

This repository doesn't really have any unit or integration tests (Jekyll sites are just a host of static site files, so there's not really any functionality to test). However, Travis CI does check that `bundler` can install the necessary dependencies and that Jekyll can properly build the site on each pull request and each commit to the `release` branch (the default branch in this repository).

## Deployments with Travis CI

Because of the use of Jekyll gems that GitHub doesn't support, this site needs to use a 3rd Party instead of GitHub Pages to compile the code. So, when Travis CI runs on the `release` branch, not only does it bundle all of the dependencies and build the site, but it also puts it into a special `./site` directory. Then, Travis CI will run a Travis Deployment to upload that directory to the `master` branch of this GitHub repository. Then, GitHub Pages automatically deploys the commits in the `master` branch. In this way, we develop the site on a pull request, we merge source code into the `release` branch, and then Travis CI builds the code and commits that automagically to the `master` branch. Then GitHub Pages does their thing.

A full deployment only takes about five to ten minutes, but depending on what was changed (HTML files, images, etc), it can take up to about fifteen minutes to propagate the changes. To make the changes appear faster, you can reload the entire website in incognito mode.

## Notifications with Travis CI

Travis CI sends a Slack notification indicating the build status after each build finishes (even on pull requests). The Slack notifications are sent to the Slack workspace [emmasax4](https://emmasax4.slack.com). You can ask for an invite to that workspace, but a final invite is not guaranteed. The workspace and notifications are set up for my personal usage, not for communciational purposes.

## HTML Proofer

We can check periodically that all of the HTML links in this website load correctly:
```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
htmlproofer --assume-extension --allow-hash-href ./_site
```

External links to LinkedIn typically return an error code, as explained [here](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer/issues/215). The other link that I usually see returning error codes is one to Digi-Key. I haven't quite figured out why that is.

If you're in the process of creating a new blog post, then most likely the external link to the new blog post will fail. This makes senseâ€”the blog post isn't live online yet, and that's what the link is checking for.

Travis CI also runs a version of the HTML Proofer which skips over all internal domains and ignores LinkedIn and Digi-Key domains. Travis CI runs this line as an `after_success`, meaning if it breaks for any reason (timeouts, moved URLs, etc), it won't hold up any deploys.

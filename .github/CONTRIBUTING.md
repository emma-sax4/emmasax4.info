# Contributing

To contribute, please follow this process:

Fork this repository: https://github.com/emma-sax4/emma-sax4.github.io/fork

| With GitHub UI | On your computer with Git |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Make the first change you'd like to make | Create your feature branch using my custom Git files:<br>`git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch` |
| When you'd like to commit your first change, make a new branch and name it appropriately | Make the first few changes you'd like to make |
| Commit your changes to your feature branch | Commit and push your changes:<br>`git commit -am "Add some feature" && git push` |
| On that feature branch, continue making your changes and committing them | Continue making changes and committing/pushing them (unless you leave your feature branch, all new commits will be automatically added to your branch) |

To see what your changes look like, follow the instructions in the [Running Locally](https://github.com/emma-sax4/emma-sax4.github.io/blob/master/README.md#running-locally) section of the README. If you've been working on GitHub directly up until this point, you may need to switch over to a computer and clone the repository and branch to do this step.

When you're satisfied, make a pull request to this repository in the UI.

If I don't comment or start looking at the pull request in a couple of days, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:emma.sax4@gmail.com).

The only thing left to do is wait for me to approve your pull request and merge it!

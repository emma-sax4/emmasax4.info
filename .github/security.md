## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you happen to find a gem that this project uses that has vulnerabilities, please let me know! I've turned on GitHub's security advisory and alert suggestions, but it's always possible that I'll miss something. To let me know there's a security vulnerability, please make a GitHub Issue as soon as possible, and I'll respond back or make appropriate changes as soon as possible.

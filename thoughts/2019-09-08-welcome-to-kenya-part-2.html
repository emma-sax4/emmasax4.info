          <h3>Part 2: The Game Drives</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 2; font-style: italic">Published Sep 8, 2019</p>

          <p>Africa considers 5 animals the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_five_game" target="_blank">Big 5</a>. That means that if you can get on a safari that will show you all 5, you just won the game lottery. They are elephants, lions, leopards, cape buffalo, and the black rhinocerous. Finding elephants are easy; they're pretty much everywhere. Cape buffalo are also easy to spot, there's lots of them all over the place.</p>

          <p>Lions are more difficult. Lionesses are okay to find... they do all of the hunting and caretaking, so they can mostly be found during the day sleeping under some trees or bushes, and then hunting at dawn and dusk. Male lions are harder, because they're notorious for being lazy. Leopards are even more challenging to find. There's plenty of leopards in eastern Africa, but they're elusive. They're good at hiding; if they don't want to be found, they won't be. Sometimes, they hang out in trees sleeping during the day.</p>

          <p>And lastly, you have your rhinocerouses. White rhinos are decently easy enough to find, they're all over if you're looking in the right places. Black rhinos, on the other hand, are super rare. If I recall correctly, there's only about 126 left in the wild, which means that if you see a black rhino, you just got very lucky. You can spot the differences between the two types between their color (white rhinos are a little lighter colored), and their snouts (white rhinos have flat snouts to graze grass, and black rhinos have pointier snouts to handle branches and bushes).</p>

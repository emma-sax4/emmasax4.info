I think my partner and I received this set for free when we made some purchase over $45 or something at the LEGO store. I wouldn't have purchased it otherwise, simply because I had never even heard of Unikitty before.

However, it was a fun little set to put together. The wagon actually rolls, and it really shoots out little pieces as it goes. It's pretty fun and cute, and Unikitty is adorable.

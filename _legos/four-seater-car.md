This 164 brick piece creates a one-of-a-kind minifigure scale car. This car is unique in LEGO land because it can seat four LEGO minifigures at once; two in the front seat, and two in the backseat. Most LEGO cars for purchase only can seat one or two minifigures, one right behind each other. The roof is removable, so you can have easy access to the inside of the car. However, the car isn't too realisticâ€”the wheels don't turn left/right. Lastly, although there is no trunk or frunk, there's plenty of room in the main part of the car for your minifigure's accessories.

Here's a link to the instructions and piece list of the car: [LEGO-building-instructions-car](/assets/resources/LEGO-building-instructions-car.pdf)

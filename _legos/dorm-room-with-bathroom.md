This dorm room is designed to be a home for two students, and also contains a combination washer/dryer and a full bathroom with a large sink/vanity, toilet, bathtub, and shower. It's vents are realistic, and contains two doors. However, there are no windows, which isn't particularly realistic.

In terms of the LEGO aspect, the room's walls are made of about 135 pieces. The two beds, desks, chairs, and armoires are completely identical, so no one student gets more furniture than any other. Viewers need to use their imagination for the armoiresâ€”I didn't create them with doors, but the idea is that there's a rod, and minifigures can hang up their clothes. There's one chest per student to keep their belongings in as well. Lastly, my original design wouldn't have put in a door with windows, but I wasn't able to find the ideal door on LEGO to purchase, so I used what I had in-stock and colored the door black.

If this were a LEGO designed set, it would include more accessories like notebooks, pens, and wall decorations, but I wanted to keep it relatively inexpensive to get all of the pieces.

Including all of the minifigures, the entire set has about 450 LEGO pieces.

Here's a link to the instructions and piece list of the dorm room: <a href="/assets/resources/LEGO-dorm-room-bathroom.pdf" target="_blank">LEGO-dorm-room-bathroom.pdf</a>

NOTES: the piece list numbers can sometimes be out of sync with what's in the LEGO Bricks and Pieces database. Sometimes I need to do a more thorough Google search in order to find the correct piece number.

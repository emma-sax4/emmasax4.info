This 163 brick piece creates a one-of-a-kind minifig-sized car. This car is unique in LEGO land because it can seat four LEGO minifigs at once; two in the front seat, and two in the backseat. Most LEGO cars for purchase only can seat one or two minifigs, one right behind each other. The roof is removable, so you can have easy access to the inside of the car. However, the car isn't too realisticâ€”the wheels don't turn left/right. Lastly, although there is no trunk or frunk, there's plenty of room in the main part of the car for your minifig's accessories.

To make the license plate, I used stickers from the [Hogwarts Whomping Willow (75953)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/hogwarts-whomping-willow-75953) set on plain 1x2 black plates.

Here's a link to the instructions and piece list of the car: [LEGO-building-instructions-car](/assets/resources/LEGO-building-instructions-car.pdf)

NOTE: the LDD piece list numbers can sometimes be out of sync with what's in the LEGO Bricks and Pieces database. Sometimes I need to do a more thorough Google search in order to find the correct piece number.

Featured in the photographs are two minifigs I've designed (who I've named Taryn and Emmy for fun).

This cute little raft was made from pieces that I found in my LEGO piece stash. The raft is LEGO piece #75977, and is found in many LEGO sets, as shown [here](https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=30086&in=S). The oars are piece #2542, and can also be found in [many LEGO sets](https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=2542&in=S). In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they overlap.

The minifigures were designed by myself, and I specifically ordered top, bottom, face, and hair pieces of each minifigure (named Ben and Olivia). The chain is the finishing touch, and allows the raft to be hooked up to a dock.

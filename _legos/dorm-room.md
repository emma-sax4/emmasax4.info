This dormitory room is designed as a mixture between a college dorm room and a Harry Potter style common room. It is designed to be a home for four students, and contains two couches, chairs, and a coffee table for the students to talk and study. It has huge windows on one side of the room, to let in plenty of natural light.

In terms of the LEGO aspect, the room's walls are made of about 175 pieces. The four beds, desks, chairs, and armoires are completely identical, so no one student gets more furniture than any other. Viewers need to use their imagination for the armoiresâ€”I didn't create them with doors, but the idea is that there's a rod, and minifigures can hang up their clothes. There's lots of chests for the students to keep their belongings in as well. Each student has a backpack, too. Lastly, my original design wouldn't have put in a door with windows, but I wasn't able to find the ideal door on LEGO to purchase, so I used what I had in-stock.

If this were a LEGO designed set, it would include more accessories like notebooks, pens, and wall decorations, but I wanted to keep it relatively inexpensive to get all of the pieces.

Including all of the minifigures, the entire set has about 500 LEGO pieces.

Here's a link to the instructions and piece list of the box: <a href="/assets/resources/LEGO-building-instructions-dorm-room.pdf" target="_blank">LEGO-building-instructions-dorm-room</a>

NOTE: the LDD piece list numbers can sometimes be out of sync with what's in the LEGO Bricks and Pieces database. Sometimes I need to do a more thorough Google search in order to find the correct piece number.

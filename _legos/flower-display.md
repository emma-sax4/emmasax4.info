In my recent newfound LEGO phase, this was one of the first little sets that I did. When I put it together, I wasn't aware of what LEGOs would turn into in my life.

My partner had the inkling that I would enjoy LEGOs since he saw me enjoy putting together Ikea furniture. So, he wanted to get me a little test set, to see if I liked it. This is what he started with. It's cute and fun, but at least the rose is a bit top-heavy, and so it falls over a lot. It's actually fallen over so many times that eventually I lost the little leaf when it fell on the backside of a heavy piece of furniture. I'm sure I'll find it again when I move next.

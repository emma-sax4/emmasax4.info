## Nairobi ‚òû [Tamarind Tree Hotel](http://www.tamarindtree-hotels.com/)

Tamarind Tree Hotel was by far the nicest place we stayed at in Nairobi. It was colorful üåà, clean üßº, the food was delicious, and the staff was pleasant. The entire hotel felt very safe, as there were security measures everywhere.

When we arrived, there was a gate at the entrance with guards. After letting our trucks in, we were surprised to find there was a metal detector at the main entrance, which everybody had to go through before entering the actual hotel. Even all of our bags had to be scanned by an x-ray machine (like TSA at the airport).

To take an elevator to any floor (besides the ground floor), you needed to have a keycard for that specific floor. I appreciated the extra feeling of security, even if it was somewhat irritating when you wanted to visit another room on a different floor.

The shower was interesting‚Äîit was just a glass door (which you could see the person's head through), and the tile floor was the same as the tiles in the rest of the bathroom. By the way, the bathroom didn't even have a door! So it felt very exposed. It was fine when I was sharing a room with somebody I knew well, but it would've been more awkward if I was rooming with someone I had just met.

The beds were small (twin sized), but comfortable, especially since we had just come off of a long flight üõ©.

The food was delicious. However, the buffet meal (we were all on our own for dinner) cost around $30, or 3,000 KSH. Therefore, I ended up ordering some spaghetti and bruschetta (and my partner ordered some steak or something) from the normal menu. But, when I asked how the buffet was, everybody said it was delicious and worth the $30 to them. To each their own ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Unfortunately, my group didn't get any pictures of Tamarind Tree Hotel, but you can check out their website online (linked above).

## Aberdares County ‚òû [The Ark](https://thearkkenya.com/)

The Ark was certainly the most unique place we stayed. The entire hotel/resort was designed to be like Noah's Ark, where the area is shaped like a boat. At the front (bow), there's four decks, and each one has an amazing view of a watering hole. A couple of the decks are actually outside, and this provides an amazing experience of the animals without glass‚Äîbut be very quiet, or else the animals will get scared üôÄ!

During the day, the watering hole and surrounding area has hyenas, buffalo, and warthogs. At night, the elephants come out, and stay for hours eating the nutrients (that are meticulously placed) in the dirt, and playing.

The rooms are small, but that's by design. They feel cozy and snug. The hallways are a maze, but you only need to know where to go a few places: your room, the entrance/exit, the decks, and the restaurant (but you can get to the food from the decks).

The air was a bit chilly at night (because of the higher altitude in the mountains), but the staff brought warm hot water packs to each bed at night, so our tootsies stayed nice and cozy.

Like Tamarind Tree Hotel, the food here was scrumptious. The breakfast had a made-to-order omelet bar, fresh juice, potatoes, eggs, fruit, rolls, and everything in between. Yum yum yum!

## Samburu ‚òû [Sarova Shaba Game Lodge](https://www.sarovahotels.com/shabalodge-samburu/)

The first thing we noticed about Sarova Shaba Game Lodge was that it was beautiful. The grounds were spectacular. There were man-made ponds with coi fish, man-made rivers to make us feel like we were out in nature, baboons and monkeys, large turtles in the rivers, crocodiles with a special crocodile watch area, a pool, gym, and plenty of space to relax at the resort. It was bright and open.

The suites themselves were arranged in little buildings with four suites in each building‚Äîtwo on the ground floor and two on top. The staff warned us to always bolt the doors because there was no latch, and so if they weren't bolted, then little primates could push their way inside the door and steal food or shiny things. One of my friends even forgot to bolt the door, and ran into a run-in with a baboon that decided to join them inside!

The food was incredible. From our first buffet meal, it was clear that their food was superior. They had pasta at every meal, rice, vegetables, bread, meat, and an entire section of desserts. I'm not a huge dessert person myself, so I didn't really try any, but everyone else I travelled with enjoyed the dessert bar.

They provided an array of extra activities we could do. Our tour guide set up a happy-hour for us that was hosted by the resort. We all went "into the bush", and they provided live Kenyan music, a guest from a Samburan tribe to talk to us about his village and his life, wine and cocktails, and appetizers. They had a cook who was also very good at photography, and he took several of us down to a river nearby to take some pictures of the setting sun.

I forgot to take any pictures of Sarova Shaba Game Lodge, and that's really a pity; the best thing about this resort was the beautiful resort grounds. But, the good news is that their website has plenty of pictures featuring the resort.

### The Samburu Village Visit

Unrelated to the lodging and food, we also took the time to visit a native Samburu village. We learned many things about the native tribes of Samburu. If I recall correctly, there are around 42 Kenyan tribes still in existance, and the Samburu people are one of them. They live in several villages.

The boys become warriors around age 15, after a live-circumcision ceremony. Then, around 25-30, they'll become junior elders. It is around this age they can marry. A warrior can marry any amount of women (who are at least 18), but the number they marry is dependent on the livestock they have (warriors determine their wealth and power based on their livestock). Each woman will have their own hut, where they'll raise their children. The husbands take turns deciding which wife's hut they'll stay in each night, and that wife is responsible for feeding the husband for the night. Around age 40, then a junior elder becomes an elder.

Children do attend school... now. In school, young children will learn Swahili and English (the two official languages of Kenya), and they'll potentially learn more languages that are tribe-specific.

Women and mothers take care of the children, take care of the livestock, do beading and art projects, and sell their crafts to visitors and other tribes. We even got the chance to purchase some of their handmade jewelry and crafts.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, we stayed in some incredible resorts in Kenya. They were definitely for the "luxury-safari-traveller", and we enjoyed every minute of our stays. The food kept us fulfilled and ready for adventure, and we managed to get a sound night's sleep each night (except that one night where I was suffering from some traveller's diarrhea ü§¢, but that's another story, and one I won't both disclosing to you here). If you choose to visit Kenya‚Äîwhich I higly recommend‚Äîjust be sure you remember your small dollar bills to tip with... the tipping community in Kenya is huge!

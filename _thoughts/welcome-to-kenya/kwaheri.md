Although our last day of in Kenya was chaotic, it was also saddening. We had all gotten so close to the other people in our van, to our other travellers with us (even the people not in our van), and to our driver. One of the stops we made on our way to the airport was at a gas station. Although our intention was to gather all of the trucks, we also used the opportunity to say goodbye to our drivers.

The day we met our drivers, we say all of them in a line, got to hear their names, and a tiny bit about them. Now, for the last time, we'd get to see our drivers/guides once more stand in a line, and say their goodbyes. I'm sure they're used to saying goodbye to tourists like us; their schedules are full of various travel companies and tourists. But, no matter how many times I say goodbye to someone in this situation, I'm sad.

We gave the last of our Kenya Shilling cash to our drivers as tips, gave all of the drivers hugs goodbye, and filed back into our trucks for the last time (except that one time at the airport through the security station). Even now, it's strange for me to think that there's new tourists having an adventure in the same seats in the same truck that we were in before.

When we got to the airport, our trip leaders were right; it was busy. We didn't have time to hug our drivers one last time, so instead, we filed to the long lines that awaited us at the airport. Kwaheri, Kenya.

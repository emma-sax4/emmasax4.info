At the end of the trip, we ended in the Maasai Mara, approximately 6 hours away from Nairobi. So, we had a long day of travel ahead of us. But, our trip planners didn't want to have a boring last day, so they planned a few extra stops. Here's what our original itinerary for the day looked like:
* 7:30am â€“ Optional activity (morning game drive, short game drive + Maasai village visit, sleeping in, etc)
* 12pm â€“ Meet for lunch at a mall between Maasai Mara and Nairobi
* 5pm â€“ Meet at Carnivore Kenya for a dinner buffet
* 8pm â€“ Arrive at Nairobi International Airport
* 10:50pm â€“ Our flight to JFK departs ðŸ›«

However, hardly anything we planned actually came to fruition. And here's why...

## The Optional Activity

## Lunch

## The Trip to Nairobi

## The Airport

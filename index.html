      <h3>
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Who am I?</h3>

      <p>Hello! My name is Emma Sax. I am a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota Morris (UMM). I graduated in May 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with High Distinction. Now, I work as a Software Engineer on the Platform Operations team at SportsEngine. Before college, I was highly involved in theatre, dance, and music around the Twin Cities, where my home is. You might've seen me on stage at the Children's Theatre Company or Stages Theatre Company. Throughout college, I was a participant in the UMM Concert Choir and the UMM Dance Ensemble. Going forward, I hope to continue to grow as a person and to pursue a career in the technology field. I currently am a Software Engineer at SportsEngine located in Northeast Minneapolis.</p>

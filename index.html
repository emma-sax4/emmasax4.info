      <h3>
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Who am I?</h3>

      <p>Hello. My name is Emma Sax (she/her/hers). I am currently a Platform Operations Engineer at <a href="https://www.sportsengine.com/solutions/">SportsEngine</a>. Before I started there full-time in 2017, I graduated from the University of Minnesota Morris (UMM) with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with High Distinction. Before college, I was highly involved in theatre, dance, and music around the Twin Cities, where I grew up, and still live today. My background in the arts has allowed me to have a unique perspective on programming, software development, and DevOps, and going forward, I hope to continue to grow as a person, artist, and engineer.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I like to go on walks and hikes, swim (as much swimming as possible), hang out with friends and family, and binge watch TV shows (my favorite one is <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_(TV_series)">Bones</a></i>). My favorite author is <a href="https://www.jodipicoult.com/">Jodi Picoult</a>; I love how her novels (which are often about controversial topics) make her readers rethink how they view the topic, society, and allow us to see that even the people that disagree with us have their reasons, and are right in their own way. These are lessons that sometimes I think Americans in the 21st Century forget. Also.... ice cream is my personal weakness.</p>

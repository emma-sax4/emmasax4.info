When people think of their 20s, what do they think of? I know what I thought of:

* fun
* getting a decent job in a bustling city, maybe around age 26–28
* just having a good time
* more fun

You get the gist of it. Of course, this is all based on what I saw on TV shows and movies that featured young women in their 20s. For the moment, let's focus on my second bullet point: "getting a decent job in a bustling city, maybe around age 26–28".

The truth, according to _The Defining Decade_, is that "[about] two-thirds of lifetime wage growth happens in the first ten years of a career" (pg. 12). This means that if young adults in their 20s continually take strings of underemployment jobs, with no hope of getting ahead (either moving into a management role, using that experience as a resumé builder for another job, etc), then by the time they're in their 30s, they've paid a high price for those jobs. "[Late] bloomers will likely never close the gap between themselves and those who got started earlier."

So, what do we do about this?

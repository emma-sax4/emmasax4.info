When people think of their 20s, what do they think of? I know what I used to think of:

* fun
* getting a decent job in a bustling city, maybe around age 26–28
* falling in love and having a rollercoaster romance
* more fun

You get the gist of it. Of course, this is all based on what I saw on TV shows and movies that featured young women in their 20s. For the moment, let's focus on the second bullet point: "getting a decent job in a bustling city, maybe around age 26–28". Although this is what those TV shows show their viewers, it's not exactly realistic, and oftentimes getting a "decent job in a bustling city" is more nuanced and complex than just starting in a secretary job in Season 1 and slowly moving up and becoming a magazine editor by Season 3.

For real people, not characters, finding the "right" job in the "right" city is not always the easy, or even the "right" thing. To help summarize what _The Defining Decade_ has explained to me, this blog post will focus on the following areas:

* [Identity Capital](#identity-capital)
* [Connections](#connections)
* [Comparisons and Expectations](#comparisons-and-expectations)
* [Your Life Doesn't Need to be Boring](#your-life-doesnt-need-to-be-boring)

## Identity Capital

The truth, according to _The Defining Decade_, is that "[about] two-thirds of lifetime wage growth happens in the first ten years of a career" (pg. 12). This means that if young adults in their 20s continually take strings of underemployment jobs, with no hope of getting ahead (either moving into a management role, using that experience as a resumé builder for another job, etc), then by the time they're in their 30s, they've paid a high price for those jobs. "[Late] bloomers will likely never close the gap between themselves and those who got started earlier" (pg. 13).

To help clarify the exact price that "late bloomers" will pay, let's crunch some numbers. Let's take a job at a retail store making $12/hour. If that person works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, that totals about $24,960 per year (ignoring taxes). Let's say they work that job for eight years. After eight years, they'll have made $199,680. Now, let's take somebody that takes a lower paying job, but a job with growth potential, and they start at $10/hour. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they'll have made $20,800 the first year. But the next year, they get a raise (let's say 4%), to now $10.40/hour. Now after the first two years, they'll have made $42,432. The next year, they get another 4% raise. In year four, they get a significant promotion, and now make $22/hour. Now, for the sake of my lazy, but long, calculator string, let's say they keep that promoted raise of $22/hour for the next four years (so they made $22/hour for a total of five years). At the end of eight years, the same as before, they'll have made $293,737.60. Feel free to correct my math, but I think I did it right.

Obviously in this example, not everybody can afford to take a lower paying job with growth potential, but this is just an example I made up.

While the whole concept of "no work and all play" is enticing, the truth is, it'll put young adults behind for years to come. This is clear from a monetary perspective, but it's also true when it comes to our mental health state. Having unfulfilling jobs can introduce an array of issues, such as depression, drinking, low self-esteem, lower stress management, and a less life satisfaction. If a person is consistently taking jobs that are below their true worth, they're slowly starting to convince themselves that they're not capable of doing anything better, for whatever reason. And as they see their friends and peers moving on, they'll start to feel behind.

So, what do we do about this? Well, if we are having trouble getting a job that fits our skillset (as, according to _The Defining Decade_, many adults in their 20s do), then we must take the job that has the most _identity capital_.

Identity capital is a collection of personal assets: the investments we make in ourselves. Maybe that involves taking the lower-paying job at the youth center, versus a barista job at Starbucks. It could be things that would eventually go on our resumé, or it could be personal, such as how we speak, where we come from, or how we look. Maybe investing in professional clothing is going to be worth more than purchasing more workout clothes (says the person who wears leggings and/or sweatpants every day... I know). All of these make you you. And when you go interview for jobs (or on a first date, or really anything with a first impression), you're marketing yourself.

If people develop lives with all capital and no crisis (all work, no exploration), their life can end up rigid and conventional. On the opposite side, people with all crisis and no capital are potentially "'in danger of becoming irrelevant'" (pg. 7). Therefore, the healthiest thing to do is aim for somewhere in the middle. Live your life and have a good time, of course. But also invest in yourself. Don't stay up until 2am every night because your work will suffer. Don't quit every job as soon as it gets difficult. Likewise, don't work until 9pm each night and neglect your social life because those friends will eventually become an invaluable support system.

Use what bits of identity capital you have to gain new bits of capital. Think of your career as a ladder. If you want to get as high on the ladder as you can (think long-term, not short-term), you need to start at the bottom. You need jump to the first rung in order to get to the second. And you need to get to the fourth to get to the fifth. Of course, it may be easier for some people to jump rungs than others (see [privilege](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privilege)). But the truth is that everybody has identity capital to use... the trick is to find which pieces will be useful to _you_.

For example, I got one of my first internship interviews because I attended the same college as the future intern's manager. In my most recent interview with a delivery company, I brought up my own crazy experience as a delivery driver with Instacart (see [My Time with Two Jobs](/blog/posts/my-time-with-two-jobs/)). All of these little bits of identity capital have been used to form my story, and my personalized story will help me get to the next level in my career.

Okay. We're onto our last section of three when it comes to looking at why our 20s are a critical time in our lives. Let's recap of the initial bullet points I developed in our first blog post:

> When people think of their 20s, what do they think of? I know what I used to think of:
>
> * fun
> * getting a decent job in a bustling city, maybe around age 26â€“28
> * falling in love and having a rollercoaster romance
> * more fun

We've talked about our second bullet point [here](/blog/posts/our-20s-matter/work/), and we've talked about the third bullet point [here](/blog/posts/our-20s-matter/love/). Although it might be enjoyable to read, I actually won't discuss the first and last bullet points. The reason for this is because our 20s are about having fun! We have less responsibilities now than we probably will in the future (when we have families, mortgages, etc), and for potentially the first time ever, we have our own money that we can spend on things like going out to eat, sports/theater/entertainment, vacation, etc. Of course we should have fun while we can (while of course planning for our future). So, if we're not talking about bullet points 1 and/or 4, then what is this blog post about?

Well, as you might've picked up from the title of this blog post, this will be about our brains and our bodies. Therefore, this blog post will cover the following topics, based on [_The Defining Decade_](https://bookshop.org/books/the-defining-decade-why-your-twenties-matter-and-how-to-make-the-most-of-them-now/9780446561754) by [Meg Jay](https://megjay.com):

## Happiness: Outside In and Inside Out
## Our Bodies at their Prime
## And You Thought Math Didn't Matter

Okay. We're onto our last section of three when it comes to looking at why our 20s are a critical time in our lives. Let's recap of the initial bullet points I developed in our first blog post:

> When people think of their 20s, what do they think of? I know what I used to think of:
>
> * fun
> * getting a decent job in a bustling city, maybe around age 26â€“28
> * falling in love and having a rollercoaster romance
> * more fun

We've talked about our second bullet point [here](/blog/posts/our-20s-matter/work/), and we've talked about the third bullet point [here](/blog/posts/our-20s-matter/love/).

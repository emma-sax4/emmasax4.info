The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Therefore, this post marks exactly one year since that date. To mark this "covidaversay", I thought I'd write a little blog post discussing 10 things I've learned this past year, both about myself, and about American society.

### 1. Every country, and person, defines "essential" differently

I don't think it's any secret that America has historically had sort of loose definitions of "essential". For example, I now haven't gotten a single haircut in a year. I don't mind having long hair, and I actually am starting to realize that for me, three haircuts a year may be a waste of my money. However, where was a big bruhaha among many people about all of the hair salons being closed.

For another example, here's a list of Australia's "essential" workers:

* Supermarkets and grocery stores
* Medical centers
* Pharmacies
* Petrol stations
* Waste industry
* Utilities companies
* Banks
* New agencies
* Post offices
* Food delivery
* Bottle shops
* All those involved in frontline response (firefighters, police, EMTs, etc)

Minnesota considers all those above "essential", but includes the following:

* Energy workers
* Transportation and logistics (public transit workers, bicycle shops, automobile sales, etc)
* Communications and information technology (newspapers, radio, television, etc)
* Election support services
* Housing, shelter, and homelessness-prevention staff
* Critical manufacturing (mining, processing operations, etc)
* Hazardous materials
* Financial services (banks, credit unions, insurance companies, etc)
* Tribal governments
* The Judicial Branch
* The Executive Branch
* Executive Constitutional Offices
* The Legislative Branch
* Federal employees
* National Guard
* Faith leaders and workers (churches)
* Education and child-care providers (teachers, principals, child-care workers, etc)
* Hotels, residential facilities, and shelters
* Charitable and social services organizations
* Notaries
* Legal services (lawyers, immigration, judges, end-of-life planning, etc)
* Laundry services
* Animal shelters and veterinarians
* Essential supply stores

Now, I'm not saying that the workers above aren't essential.. in fact, I think those job are super important to society and to our world. However, what it meant for our COVID recovery is that _too many_ people fell into that "essential" category. Even during the first few quarantines, since so many people were still leaving the house for their "essential" job, it actually prevented our society from overcoming the virus.

By comparison, other countries with more limited "essential" lists would shut down almost everything for two weeks, and the virus would be gone for a while. At that point, people could go out and about and live life (without masks) again. And if/when another family tests positive, they'd do the strict quarantine again. And from what I've seen on the internet, the people that live in those countries don't mind the approach their government took.

To America, it felt extreme to shut down everything for two weeks in order to stop the spread. It seemed better at the time to just shut down half of society, and hope that was enough. But at one year into the pandemic, I'm not sure if we took the right approach.

This was exacerbated by the fact that each state had its own rules and regulations. Because our federal government took such a laissez-faire approach, each state was left to fend for themselves and make their own decisions. But the thing is, Americans cross states all the time. What one state does will _undeniably_ affect the neighboring states. The decisions Texas makes will somehow affect all 48 continental states.

And this brings me to my next item...

### 2. COVID-19 has affected everyone... but some more than others

There was a point perhaps last May where I wondered if there was anybody left in the country who _hadn't_ heard of COVID-19. Maybe somebody who lived a very isolated life, never talking to anybody, never going on the internet or reading the news. But at this point, I can almost guarantee that unless a person was raised by wolves, they've heard of wearing a mask.

This pandemic has affected everyone. It has changed how everyone lives, how we work, what we wear, what we do. But some of us are way more affected than others. For many white-collar workers, the only things that really changed for them in day-to-day life was that they now work from their kitchen, or home office. Maybe their kids spend more time at home. Maybe they increased their internet speeds. But for blue-collar workers and the older and younger generations, this pandemic turned their life upside down.

I think of the elementary aged children who didn't even quite understand what was going on. They go home from school one day, just to realize that their spring break has now become 6 months of not seeing their friends. And children need socialization to develop properly! I think of the older generation of people that maybe before didn't even use their computer, but now are completely dependent for it for everything, from visiting family, to making appointments, to shopping. I think of the performers and artists in New York, who suddenly saw their entire life shut down when the theaters stopped doing shows. Some of them haven't been on a stage in an entire year, meaning a huge portion of their income may be completely gone. Many people have had to dip into their savings, just to keep food on their dinner table. And I'm sure that this paragraph doesn't even properly give their feelings and  experience justice.

So while some of us are purchasing new homes, doing house renovations, buying new furniture, and investing in home pelotons, there are others out there who are just struggling to make it through the week. People who are still trying to figure out how to pay February's rent. People who are struggling to figure out how to help their kid learn algebra while working 30 hours a week at a grocery store, while working 20 hours a week at Target.

Speaking of being at a store for 30 hours a week...

### 3. Masks aren't so bad if you have the right mask and/or mask accessories

What do I mean?, you may ask. If you're anything like me, the first few masks you had were homemade with a sewing machine and spare fabric. But at this point, you've probably invested in some Etsy made or factory made masks. While there are some types of masks with a rigid shape so that it doesn't get sucked into our mouths, those aren't the ones I own.

I'll admit I'm pretty cheap... I just bought a couple of the cheap packs of masks from Target. They're just a couple layers of fabric, although sometimes I'll double them up. And I quickly found that whenever I took a deep breath in, especially when at the gym, they would get sucked into my mouth and make it hard to breathe. And so the first accessories I purchased was a set of [mask guards](https://www.google.com/search?q=mask+guards&sxsrf=ALeKk033pi5uWe1paZy_L14DES8ihvuE_Q:1615145317207&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwis1pGX9Z7vAhVFa80KHWnCArAQ_AUoAnoECB0QBA&biw=1228&bih=949). These are so helpful. They go between the mask and my face, and make it so that no matter what I can clearly breathe with the mask on. They may look a little like muzzles, but they make a world of difference for me.

The next hugest discomfort for me was the pulling on my ears. Almost all of the masks I own have over-the-ear loops. And especially when doubled up, they pull on my ears, and so wearing the mask for more than 20 mintues is pretty uncomfortable for me. So next I purchased some [mask lanyards](https://www.amazon.com/Lanyard-Essential-Accessory-Glasses-Attachment/dp/B08HXCXRQC/ref=asc_df_B08HXCXRQC/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=475857959892&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1448916636927237682&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9019679&hvtargid=pla-1093695320367&psc=1). The specific set I purchased not only works as a lanyard around my neck, but also can be used to hold the mask in place... aka you tighten the straps around our head or neck instead of wrapping it around the ears. And this makes wearing the mask way more manageable for me.

And lastly, if I want the mask to stay up higher on the head instead of falling looser around the neck, I grab some hairties, put my hair in a high ponytail, tighten the lanyard on top of the ponytail, and then clip the mask lanyard to my head so it is higher. Voil√†!

### 4. Zoom calls scientifically take more energy from us than being in-person

### 5. The past year has made it apparent that humans really are social animals

### 6. Internet should be viewed as a necessary utility, not a privilege

### 7. Those who already had home offices set up last March were lucky

I need to start of this blog post by clarifying: tomorrow is useful. When I'm planning my week, it's quite useful to be able to say "I need to go to the store tomorrow." It's pretty much necessary to acknowledge tomorrow when I'm talking about making plans in the future, and what you intend to do. However, what I'm talking about is the conceptual idea of Tomorrow (with a capital T).

Some helpful definitions (most of which I just made up):
* tomorrow: the word as defined in the dictionary, used in a sentence‚Äîa tangible and understandable day that is coming up in the near future
* today: the word as defined in the dictionary, used in a sentence‚Äîthe present date
* _Tomorrow_: the conceptual idea of tomorrow, but in reality, just an unclear date in the near future that is not explicit, understandable, or tangible
* _Today_: the conceptual idea of today‚Äîthe present moment and date

I need to start of this blog post by clarifying: tomorrow is useful. When I'm planning my week, it's quite useful to be able to say "I need to go to the store tomorrow." It's pretty much necessary to acknowledge tomorrow when I'm talking about making simple plans in the future, and what I intend to do. In this case, tomorrow is a tangible thing, after all, it's just a day of the week that's coming up in the future. However, what I'm talking about is the conceptual idea of _Tomorrow_ (with a capital T). And in this case, _Tomorrow_ is not useful at all.

In short, the reason _Tomorrow_ is not useful is because _Tomorrow_ will never happen. _Tomorrow_ is the short name for "in the near, but not explicit, future." But what is literally and tangibly tomorrow at this very moment, will eventually become today, and what is conceptually _Tomorrow_, will never become _Today_.

I know the concept is a little bit confusing to explain, so I'll try to explain with an example. If today is Friday, then tomorrow is Saturday (woohoo, it's the weekend üéâ). But when tomorrow actually rolls around, then today is Saturday. And when we tell ourselves "I need to go to the store tomorrow," we actually mean "I need to go to the store on Saturday." And since now tomorrow is today, it means it's time to go to the store.

But how many times have we told ourselves we're going to do something _Tomorrow_, a.k.a., in the very near future? I know I've done it multiple times ‚úãüèº. "I'm going to start that new diet _Tomorrow_." "I'm going to go to the gym _Tomorrow_." "I'm going to call my grandmother _Tomorrow_." "Why don't we just clean up the garage _Tomorrow_?" We say these sentences when we don't really _want_ to do whatever thing we're planning. We're saying we'll do the task _Tomorrow_ because we don't want to do it _Today_. We're saying we'll do the task _Tomorrow_ with the idea that _Tomorrow_, we'll be a better, more productive, kinder, healthier, etc, person.

But what I want to urge you (and myself) to consider is that instead of wanting to be that better person _Tomorrow_ (in the near future), why don't we try to become that person _Today_? "I'm going to start that diet _Today_." "I'm going to go to the gym _Today_." If we keep telling ourselves we're going to do something _Tomorrow_... well, _Tomorrow_ will never arrive. What we've got‚Äîall we've got‚Äîis _Today_. And tomorrow, we'll still only have _Today_.

So start those projects you've been putting off _Today_. Start eating carrots instead of chips _Today_. Start a new exercise routine _Today_. All we have is _Today_, and that's all we're ever going to have. A person's life is simply made up of a lot of _Today_s strung together in a row. And the goals, good deeds, and tasks that we continue to put off until some time in the near, but not explicit, future will never actually happen _until_ we decide that we're ready to start them _Today_.

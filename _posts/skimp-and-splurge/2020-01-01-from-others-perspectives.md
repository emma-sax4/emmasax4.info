One of my intentions for the [_Skimp and Splurge_](/blog/skimp-and-splurge/) blog collection is that it can be used by young adults to help them figure out which items are important for them to fit into their budget. I want my readers to understand that for every person, what they prioritize in their budget is personal, and what I find valuable, somebody else may not want or need in their budget. Therefore, I knew it'd be important to get some other folks' opinions on each of these topics, so that my readers have more data to parse and more opinions for them to base their choices on.

So, like any good blogger, I conducted interviews. I intended to interview around five people for this post, but I ended up only getting two. So, the post won't be quite as long as originally inteded, but it'll still suffice.

One of my intentions for the <a href="/blog/skimp-and-splurge/" target="_blank">_Skimp and Splurge_</a> blog collection is that it can be used by young adults to help them figure out which items are important for them to fit into their budget. I want my readers to understand that for every person, what they prioritize in their budget is personal, and what I find valuable, somebody else may not want or need in their budget. Therefore, I knew it'd be important to get some other folks' opinions on each of these topics, so that my readers have more data to parse.

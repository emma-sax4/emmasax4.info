This was initially written in December of 2016, even if I'm publishing it in 2019. In a way, it was my first attempt at a blog post (just not on this blog). So, I thought it'd be interesting to document it here. Since writing this, some amount of my opinions on these ideas have changed a little bit. Stay tuned for an updated list coming soon ðŸ˜‰.

There comes a point in most young adultsâ€™ lives where they need to think about saving money. Whether they just graduated from college, just bought their first car, or are trying to save for a special occasion, itâ€™s important to understand that money doesnâ€™t grow on trees. Thereâ€™s rarely a way for an average, middle-class 20-something-year-old to afford everything theyâ€™d like to have and have a reasonable savings account, too. Therefore, itâ€™s up to the person to decide how theyâ€™d like to spend their money. Which usually involves a mixture of, what I call, "skimping" on things and "splurging" on things.

Hereâ€™s 10 things my list of "skimps" and "splurges":
1. **SKIMP: daily coffee**. In fact, I donâ€™t drink any coffee at all. Call me lucky that I donâ€™t need the pick-me-up of energy in the morning, but because of it, I can easily save $150 a month from frequent trips to Starbucks.
2. **SPLURGE: apartment rent**. Even though apartments provide a low-contract living situation, I like knowing that the place Iâ€™m living in is decently nice, in a good neighborhood, and I would feel comfortable living there for years to come if I wanted to. And itâ€™s not like I was super picky. In fact, my requirement for living there included 6 things:
* Central heat
* Air conditioning
* Dishwasher
* Underground parking available
* Free laundry (does not necessarily mean in-unit washer/dryer)
* Fitness room in building
3. **SKIMP: tons of new clothes**. Call it luck that at my job, jeans and t-shirts are totally appropriate, but I never am willing to spend more than about $30 on a shirt or a pair of pants if I donâ€™t have to. Stay away from the designer stores and expensive retail stores. I only buy expensive clothes when I know Iâ€™ll be wearing them to a very important occasion.
4. **SPLURGE: eating at nice restaurants**. I donâ€™t mean super pricey restaurants, just ones that arenâ€™t fast-food chains. I would never skip on going out to eat with an old friend at a decently nice restaurant. Worst case scenario, Iâ€™m fed with good-tasting food, my wallet is $45 lighter, and Iâ€™ve gotten some socializing done with friend(s). Could be worse. And Iâ€™ll probably get leftovers out of it, too.
5. **SKIMP: tons of takeout and fast-food**. Although it doesnâ€™t seem like much, a monthâ€™s worth of take out fees and fast-food adds up. Iâ€™d much rather cook one meal, and have it and its leftovers last me three days than spend $5-10 every two days on lunches.
6. **SPLURGE: Netflix**. Of course everyone will have different opinions about this, but for me, Netflix is a necessity. Almost right up there with internet. For me, Netflix can easily occupy 3 hours worth of time, and it is a good distraction from the rest of your life when you just need a break.
7. **SKIMP: expensive phone bills with tons of unused data**. If you plan on getting Internet and WiFi at your apartment, like most people have, then you can skip on the data a little bit. For me, 5GB is plenty for the occasional watching of videos and browsing the web. But to each their own (some people use over 10GB a month, and I know that).
8. **SPLURGE: a good car**. Yes, my car was not cheap. I got a brand new Honda CR-V, with only 11 miles on it. The reason I got this car was because I think of it like an investment. If I bought a cheap car with 120,000 miles on it and it needed maintenance and new parts, then I spend the original amount on the car, plus gas, insurance, the maintenance, and parts. And, it could only last me 2-3 more years. But, if I buy a nice car that isnâ€™t old and doesnâ€™t need a lot of work, assuming I take proper care of the car, it could potentially last me 7 more years. And, I love my car.
9. **SKIMP: buying a couch right when I move out**. The truth is, when you first move out, there are some things you need. Some pots and pans, and a shower curtain fall under that list. There are also some things you donâ€™t need right away. A couch and a TV are in that list. Couches are expensive. Besides the bed/mattress and the dining table/chairs, itâ€™ll be in the top 5 most expensive things youâ€™ll buy for quite a while (at least in terms of furniture). Therefore, skip the couch. If youâ€™re a college student, youâ€™re probably used to lying on your bed watching cute animal videos anyway, so youâ€™ll do just fine without a couch if you wait a couple months.
10. **SPLURGE: a good bed**. The thing with mattresses is, the better quality mattress you buy, the longer itâ€™ll last, the more comfortable itâ€™ll be, and the better youâ€™ll sleep. And hopefully youâ€™ll learn sometime in your adult life that sleeping is never something you should skimp on if you can help it.

Well, I hope this list might help you as you begin to budget, make real money  for yourself, and figure out how you want to live your financial life. Thanks for reading!

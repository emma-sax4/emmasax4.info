Within the past couple months, I've been trying a new daily routine of practicing gratitude. I've known for quite a while that continually practicing gratitude will naturally make me happierâ€”acknowledging the things that are going well in my life will make it easier for me to appreciate my life and the people in it, instead of dwelling on what isn't going well.

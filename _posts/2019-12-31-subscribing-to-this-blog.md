Earlier this week, a reader of this site (no, not my mother), emailed me saying that they wish that my blog had a "Subscribe" feature so they could be notified when a new blog post is published. I decided that it could be cool to implement that feature, although it may be difficult given my site doesn't have a database or a backend.
